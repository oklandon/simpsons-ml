        its workers left to fight in the second World War.  When they
        returned, the old girl was just as they'd left her, only now she
        was infested with thousands, upon thousands of rats.

<em>Scratchy reads "Nice" magazine in a rocking chair when the doorbell
rings.  He looks both ways out the spyhole, then his eye bulges out as
he looks down.  He undoes the many door locks and bolts, grabs a
shotgun, then opens the door a crack and points the gun at the basket
that's been left on his doorstep.  He throws the blanket aside and sees
a young Itchy with a baby bonnet sucking on a bottle.  His heart fills
with love and he cuddles the youngster to him.  Itchy smashes his
bottle, laughing, and uses it to dig two big bloody hunks out of
Scratchy's chest.  Scratchy collapses, and Itchy walks over him into the
house, then back out again with a TV.  He walks away laughing, leaving a
trail of bloody footprints.  Scratchy has the strength remaining to
weep, "Why?  Why?  My only son," whereafter he collapses.

   Lisa:           |         |         |Does too!
   Bart:           |         |         |         |Does not!
   \&gt;
   Lisa:  Then how come she's not putting on any of your perfume?
   Bart:  [worried]  Yeah...  Hey Mom, how come you're not putting on any of my
          perfume?
   Marge: [diplomatically]  Well I'm saving it... for a special occasion.
   Bart:  What the hell are you talking about?  There's gallons of it!
   Homer: [barks] Bart!
   Marge: [eyes darting]  But this occasion is already so special,
          if we make it any &lt;more&gt; special, we might end up making it
          &lt;less&gt; special.
   Bart:  Gotcha!  [to Lisa]  I told you she liked mine better.
   Lisa:  Oh, brother.

          Beauty, isn't she?

</em><em> That evening in bed, Homer tries to defend his gift selection to

</em><em> Marge enters Barney's (new) Bowl-a-rama, carrying her birthday

</em>   
   Marge:     Excuse me, where do I throw this?
   Attendant: Over there.
   Marge:     Thank you.  [heads off]
   Attendant: Hey---wait a minute!  You're going need a lane!
   Marge:     No thanks, I'm just here out of spite.
   Attendant: [pointing to sign reading...]  Can't bowl without a lane.
   Marge:     Well, all right.
   Attendant: [hands her a scoresheet]  Here you go... you keep score on this.
              What sized shoes you wear?
   Marge:     Never you mind!
   Attendant: [pointing to another sign]  Can't wear street shows on the lane.
              You gotta wear bowling shoes.  What size please?
   Marge:     [grudgingly]  Hmhmm... Thirteen double A.
   Attendant: Thirteen double A!!!  [whistles in amazement]  The closest I've
              got is a nine and a fifteen.

<em> Marge takes her lane, puts on her bowling shoes...
</em>   
   They're a little warm and moist.
   -- Marge puts on (rented) bowling shoes, ``Jacques to be Wild''
   
<em> ... steps up to the toe line, gets the basic idea, then hurtles the
</em><em> bowling ball down the lane (thump-thump-thump), knocking over the
</em><em> seven pin.  In the next land, a male bowler bowls a strike and
</em><em> collects a wager, to the cheers of adoring women.  He then spots
</em><em> Marge.  Marge gives the bowling ball another heave, and she knocks
</em><em> over the seven pin---in the next lane.
</em>   
   Marge:  I'm awfully sorry!
   Bowler: Entirely my fault.  It's nice to meet you...
           [looks at her bowling ball]  Homer.
   Marge:  No no.  Homer is my... ball's name.
   -- ``Jacques to be Wild''
   
<em> Marge fills in her scoresheet.  The man approaches.  As he talks to
</em><em> her, we see him caressing her hand in the overhead projector.
</em>   
   Bowler:  Your fingers are so slender, so feminine.  They're far too tapered
            for the ball you are using.  You need something lighter, more
            delicate.  Here, use my ball.
   Marge:   No, no thank you Mister... [looking at his bowling ball] Brunswick.
   -- ``Jacques to be Wild''
   
<em> Marge declines Jacques' offer.
</em>   
   Many people have senseless attachments to heavy clumsy things such as
   this Homer of yours.
   -- Jacques, ``Jacques to be Wild''
   
<em> Jacques offers to give Marge bowling lessons, and Marge agrees after
</em><em> some prodding.  He asks her to throw the ball, and she does.  Again,
</em><em> she knocks over only the seven pin.  ``I can hit that one pin all

</em><em> Marge to his lane and instructs her to ``Throw, damn you!''  She

</em>   
   Marge:   You're a very good teacher!
   Jacques: Yes I am a very good teacher and I can teach you everything.  I can
            tell you what the little arrows on the wood floor mean.  Which frame
            is the beer frame.

<em> Jacques then tells a leetle joke and is enchanted by Marge's

   Jacques: Twenty-five dollars.
   Marge:   [shocked]  Twenty five dollars!

</em><em>
</em><em> Jacques introduces Marge to the bowling lane, up close and personal.
</em>   
   Jacques: First, you must get to know your lane.  Feel the slickness, feel the
            slippery finish. Caresses it, experience it. Quite smooth, isn't it?
   Marge:   Oh, very smooth.
   \&lt;
   Jacques: Smooth?
   Marge:          |Yes, very.
   Jacques:        |          |Yes?
   Marge:          |          |    |Yes.
   Jacques:        |          |    |    |Yes.
   Marge:          |          |    |    |    |Smooth.
   Jacques:        |          |    |    |    |       |Smooth.
   Marge:          |          |    |    |    |       |       |Yes.
   Jacques:        |          |    |    |    |       |       |    |Yes.
    :        You could eat off of it.
   \&gt;
   Marge:   Hmmmm...
   Jacques: You hungry?
   Marge:   Yes.
    Jacques: [yelling]  Four Onion rings!
   
   Back at the house,
   
    Lisa:  [finishing her pizza]  Hummm!  Deliciouso!
    Bart:  My compliments to the delivery boy.
    Homer: Ok, we've eaten and eaten well.  Now what else do we have to do?
           Well, let's check the list your Mom left us...  Eat, huhmmmm,
           [ticks with a pencil]  Oh, clean up!  Now don't worry everybody, this
           will be a breeze if we all pitch in.  [they form a human chain to the
           bin]  Allright!  We're clean!  Now we'll... [looks to Maggie]
           Put Maggie to bed.
   
   In Maggie's bedroom.  Homer, Bart and Lisa stand beside Maggie's cot.
   
    Homer,Bart and Lisa:
           Lullaby, and goodnight,
           come to bed and sleep tight.
           Close your eyes, start to yawn.
           Pleasant dreams until the dawn.
   
   Homer is exhausted.  Later that night Marge enters the bedroom dressed in her
   sleeping gown.
   
    Marge: Homer, Homer?
    Homer: Huh?  Wah?  Oh,  How was bowling?
    Marge: It's a very challenging hobby.
    Homer: Heh heh,  It's a sport dear.  It's a sport you silly thing.
    Marge: But I think I'll do much better tomorrow night.
    Homer: [shocked/surprised]  Oh!  You're going back?
    Marge: Oh sure, if you don't mind taking care of the kids again.
    Homer: [confused]  Oh, no,  I don't mind.
   
   They say goodnight to each other.  At Marge's next bowling lesson, Jacques
   gives her a bowling glove.
   
    Marge:   Jacques!  It fits, you got it in my size and it has my name on it.
             It's really for me!
    Jacques: [thrusts himself upon her]  Seventeen fifty, enjoy it my darling.
   
   Marge bowls and leaves only a single pin standing, then looks to Jacques
   pleased with her improvement.  Jacques massages her hands over a steam vent,
   and they look into each others' eyes.  He fits Marge out with a new pair of
   bowling shoes (nb: four toes), teaches her to hold a ball correctly, assists
   marking the scoresheet, helps her to dip a onion ring, more gazing into each
   others' eyes, the final bowling pin topples...
   
   Jacques gives Marge a lift home.
   
    Marge:   You didn't have to drop me off.
    Jacques: But I wanted to. [grasps her hand]  Marge, do you know how beautiful
             you look in the moonlight?
    Marge:   Errrr, Jacques!  I'm a married woman!
    Jacques: I know, I know.  My mind says stop, but my heart, and my hips, cry
             proceed.  [Marge reacts accordingly]  Marge darling, I - I want to
             see you tomorrow.  Not at Barney's Bowlorama, away from the
             thunderous folly of clattering pins.  Meet me tomorrow for Brunch.
    Marge:   What's Brunch?
    Jacques: You'd love it,  It's not quite breakfast, it's not quite lunch, but
             it comes with a slice of cantaloupe at the end.  You don't get
             completely what you would at breakfast, but you get a good meal!
    Marge:   I don't think so.
    Jacques: Marge, darling.  There are ten pins in my heart, you've knocked
             over eight.  Won't you please pick up that spare?
    Marge:   [hesitantly]  Mmmm, mmmmm... All right!
   
   Marge returns to bed.  Homer feels something has changed between them, but
   isn't able to express it.  They fall asleep isolated from each other.
   
   The next morning,  Otto pulls up in front of the house.
   
    Bart:  O-ho!  School bus!
    Marge: [holding two grocery bags full of goodies]  Here you go kids,
           Special lunches!  Lots of good things for growing bodies, [Bart and
           Lisa look to each other bewildered]  and some treats just for fun.
    Bart:  Aye Carumba!
    Lisa:  Are you going bowling again tonight Mom?
    Marge: Yes I am, as a matter of fact.  [tops up their lunches, to Bart's
           delight, but Lisa is worried]  Here's more treats.  But don't worry,
           your Dad will take care of dinner.
    Bart:  [delighted]  Hmmm, Wednesday.  Hoagie night!
    Marge: [kisses Lisa]  Goodbye Lisa, my darling little Lisa.
           [kisses Bart]  Goodbye Bart, my special little guy.
   
   Bart and Lisa are sitting next to each other on the bus.  Bart has already
   started lunch.
   
    Bart: Hmm, Great lunches, hey Lis?
    Lisa: Oh Bart, don't you see?  This is what psychologists call Over-
          compensation,  Mom is racked with guilt because their marriage is
          failing.
    Bart: Hey, don't rock the boat Man.  Whatever it is, we're making out like
          bandits.
    Lisa: Bart, I've read about what happens to kids who's parents no longer
          love and cherish each other.  They go through eight separate stages.
          Right now I'm in stage three, Fear.  You're in stage two, Denial.
    Bart: [whines]  No I'm not.
    Lisa: Yes you are.
    Bart: [angrily]  No I'm not!
    Lisa: Yes you are!
    Bart: Am not!  Am not!  Am not!
    Lisa: I stand corrected,
   
   Jacques inspects the brunch menu at a Cajun restaurant, while Marge nervously
   wrings a napkin in her hands.
   
    Jacques: Mimosa?
    Marge:   I'm a married woman, please don't call me that.
    Jacques: [laughs]  Nononono.  Mimosa is the name of the drink.  It's orange
             juice and champagne.  [laughs]  You're so wonderful that you thought
             it was something offensive.
    Marge:   [accepting the compliment]  Oooo, well thank you.
   
   Helen Lovejoy, the gossipy wife of the Minister recognizes Marge (who tries to
   hide behind a menu.)
   
    Helen:   [at 78rpm]  I had just finished eating and was about to leave, when
             I looked over this way and said to myself, Huh!  Isn't that Marge
             Simpson over there, having brunch with a man who isn't her husband?
             [Jacques is annoyed, Marge forces a smile].  Ha ha, and I just had
             to come over and say Hello!
    Marge:   We're..  um..
    Helen:   Oh, don't squirm on my account.
    Jacques: I am giving her a bowling lesson, thank you.  Now Marge, [using the
             salt shakers]  The pins on the 3-7-10 split would be here.  We'll
             make this little piece of food here the ball, the ball's bigger, you
             know that. [Helen suspects something]  but for food, this is a good
             ball.
    Helen:   Ahem, well, byebye. [to Marge]  See you in church on Sunday, Marge.
    Marge:   [cheerlessly]  Good-bye Helen.
    Jacques: Goodbye Helen.  You have a lovely friend there, [Marge "Hmmm's"
             unhappily]  Let's hope something runs over her.  [Marge sniggers]
             Your laughter is like music to me, but if you laugh at what I say
             next, I will die.  For I am about to say something very serious,
             perhaps shocking.  Marge my darling, I want you to meet with me,
             again.
    Marge:   That doesn't shock me.
    Jacques: [reaching across the table]  Away from prying eyes, away from the
             Helen's of the world.  At my apartment, the Fiesta Terrace.
   
   Marge faints.
   
   She dreams, (with a definite bowling motif and a light grey and pink scheme.)
   Dressed in a apricot ballroom gown, she rings a doorbell and Jacques (dressed
   in a tuxedo) answers the door.  (``I've been waiting for you.  Come in my
   captivating one.'')  Curtains rise revealing the interior to his (lavishly
   furnished) apartment.  The two of them dance, and during a (whatever they call
   that dance movement) Marge notices a trophy case filled with awards.
   
    Marge:   You certainly have a lot of bowling trophies.
    Jacques: Ha ha, [whispered]  I like you so much.  They're not for bowling
             Marge.  You're so naive,  They're for lovemaking!
    Marge:   Really?
   
   After a most stylish sequence of them dancing together, Marge rests at a
   cocktail bar and Jacques offers her a Champagne.  They sip with their arms
   entwined, then toss the glasses over their shoulders and resume dancing.
   
    Jacques: What cosmic force brought us together Marge?
    Marge:   Destiny!
    Jacques: Yes.  Some divine pin-spotter, must have placed us, side-by-side.
    Marge:   Like two fragile bowling pins.
    Jacques: Standing bravely.
    Marge:   Until inevitably,
    Jacques: We must topple.
   
   Marge's fantasy concludes.  Jacques is trying to revive her has she lies on
   the restaurant floor.
   
    Jacques: Marge!  Marge!  Speak to me!
    Marge:   Is Thursday ok?
    Jacques: It's ok indeed.
   
   Homer changes from his shirt in the bedroom and notices a photograph on the
   dressing table of him and Marge together.  He discovers the bowling glove in
   the dresser (``For... Marge?''), and sadly realizes that Marge must be seeing
   someone else.  He places the glove back in drawer and sits cheerlessly on the
   end of the bed.  Bart trots in with a baseball glove.
   
    Bart:  Hey Dad!  Whatawe say we toss the old apple around, huh?  Sound like
           fun?
    Homer: Son, I don't know if I can lift my head, let alone a ball.
    Bart:  Come on Dad, get the lead out.
   
   Bart drags Homer out of the bedroom by the arm.  Homer stands listlessly at
   the far end of the backyard wearing a baseball glove.
   
    Bart:  [practicing his baseball]  Simpson checks the runner on first, he's
           cool(?) on sign.  Here's the windup,  and Heerree's the pitch,
           [beaning Homer on the forehead.  Homer slumps to the ground and
           Bart runs to him]  Dad, you didn't even say `Ouch!'
    Homer: Oh...  Sorry...  Ouch.
   
   Worried, Bart runs to Lisa (sitting underneath the porch light with Maggie).
   
    Bart: Lisa, Lisa, I think you're right about Dad.  There's something very
          very wrong here.
    Lisa: Bart, welcome to stage three, Fear.
    Bart: [urgently]  Well come on!  We've got to do something man!
    Lisa: Sorry Bart, I would love to help you but I am mired in stage five,
          Self-pity.
   
   Bart runs back to Homer.
   
    Bart:  Look Dad, I don't know what's going on, but once you gave me some
           advice that might help.
    Homer: I gave you advice?  Get outta here.
    Bart:  Yeah, you did.  You told me when something's bothering you, and you're
           too damn stupid to know what to do, just keep your fool mouth shut.
           At least that way you won't make things worse.
    Homer: Hmmm, good advice.
   
   Marge is in the kitchen making sandwiches.  Homer enters and almost reaches
   for his wife's hand, but pauses to pick up his lunch box instead.  As he is
   about to leave through the back door, he turns around and looks to Marge.
   
    Homer: Marge, may I.. speak to you?
    Marge: Sure.
    Homer: You know, I've been thinking.  Everyone makes peanut butter and jelly
           sandwiches, but usually the jelly drips out over the sides and the
           guy's hands get all sticky.  But your jelly stays right in the middle
           where it's supposed to.  I don't know how you do it.  You've just got
           a gift I guess, and I've always thought so,  I've just never
           mentioned it.  But it's time you knew how I feel.  I don't believe in
           keeping feelings bottled up.  [pause]  Goodbye my wife.
    Marge: ...Goodbye Homer.
   
   In his apartment at the Fiesta Terrace, Jacques prepares himself in front of
   the bathroom mirror.
   
    Jacques: To the most beautiful moment in life,  Better than a deed, better
             than a memory, the moment... of anticipation!
   
    Jacques: Oh Jacques, you handsome devil.  Look at you,  You're really going
             to  STRIKE OUT TONIGHT!
   
   The SNPP during lunch-time.  Homer sits staring forlornly at his sandwich.
   
    Lenny: Ain't you hungry Homer?
    Homer: Starving.
    Lenny: Then why aren't you eating your sandwich?
    Homer: How can I eat it?  She made it,  It's all I have left.
   
   Homer packs up his sandwich and walks away.  The technician recognizes a
   ``Domestic Situation''.
   
   Marge is driving through Springfield on her way to see Jacques.  Stopping at
   the traffic lights she sees a wedding, and averts her eyes to the other
   direction only to see a young couple wheeling a pram.  The lights turn green
   and she speeds off.  At the next stop sign Marge uneasily watches a family at
   a picnic, and the elderly couple walking down the path at the next stop drives
   the point further, with the help of two gravestones side-by-side and two
   skeletons (costumes) holding hands.
   
   At the turnoff to the SNPP and the Fiesta Terrace, Marge initially heads
   towards the Fiesta, but skids to a halt and reverses to the SNPP.  She returns
   to the intersection and sits staring at the turnoff sign.

   Marge enters the Power plant, to the surprise of all the workers clad in their
   radiation suits.  She marches down the main corridor, attracting the attention
   of everyone including Mr Burns.  Her silhouette passes a doorway, and finds
   Homer working unhappily at a waste separator.
   
    [Taps him on the shoulder]
    Homer: Marge!  What a lovely surprise!  You're hear to see me, right?
    Marge: Of course!  [cuddles and kisses him on the cheek]
   
   Homer picks her up and carries her past his cheering co-workers.  (``Way to go
   Homer, Way to Go!'')
   
    Worker: Hey, what will I tell the boss?
    Homer:  Tell him I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love,
            and I won't be back for ten minutes!
   
   Continued applause and cheering from the other employees.  Marge wears Homer's
   Safety helmet as he carries her outside into the sunset.

     <b>Burns: </b>Shut up, you!
-- Burns' diabolical plan unfolds, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

<em>"Take one last look at the sun, Springfield!" he exhorts, pressing a
button on a remote control.  A giant shield lifts out of a mountain and
blocks out the sun.  Burns laughs uncontrollably as it does so.  Krusty
runs up the steps to the town hall in shorts with a suitcase and does
his trademark laugh.  "I've been in Reno for six weeks.  Did I miss
anything?"  When he sees everyone looking aghast, he turns around.
Everyone starts leaving in the gloom.
</em>

       toting lowlife when you need one?
<b>Snake: </b>Sorry, I was in the can.
-- Even criminals have to go, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part One"

<em>Burns walks down the street and sighs, "Perpetual twilight, bathed in
the glow of Burns brand electricity."  He jumps onto a lamppost and
rhymes, "Hello, lamppost.  Whatcha knowin'?  I've come to watch your...
power flowin'."
</em>
<em>Back at the town hall, Carl reaches for a jacket.  "That's odd," he
remarks, "Mr. Smithers left his jacket behind."  The camera cuts back to
an overhead view of Mr. Burns walking down the street and whistling.
</em>
<em>Otto, still in the Town Hall, observes, "Whoa, that's odd.  Principal
Skinner left his mother behind."  Burns walks past a park bench humming.
</em>
<em>Marge loads Maggie into the station wagon.  She looks around: "That's
odd.  Where's Homer?  And Bart?  And Lisa?  And Grampa?"  Mr. Burns is
humming and walking down yet another street.  The camera cuts to the
Simpson yard where the gun box sits open and empty atop a pile of dirt.
</em>
<em>Burns says to himself, "After all these years, things are finally
starting to go my way.  I feel like celebrating."  He walks past the
corner of a building; only his shadow is visible.  Suddenly, he stops
walking.  Burns says, "I -- oh, it's you.  What are you so happy
about?...I see.  I think you'd better drop it.  I said, drop it!"  Some
noises of Burns struggling are heard, after which he says, "Get your
hands off!"
</em>
<em>The camera cuts back to Marge who asks, "Where is everybody?"  A gunshot
is heard.  Burns stumbles from around a corner, gasping, a bullet wound
on the left side of his chest.  Jimbo asks him, "Hey, man, are you OK?"
Burns stammers, "I won't dignify that with a response," then collapses
on the sundial.

Milhouse watch as a door opens and a huge shadow walks out of the
blinding white light, smoke billowing around its form as its footfalls
shake the room.  It turns out to be the change boy, and he says, "I'm

something for dinner.  "Steak?"  Homer guesses happily, but Marge says
the money's too tight.  "Steak?"  Homer guesses again, and Marge says

</em>
Ah, the last peanut -- overflowing with the oil and salt of its departed
brothers.
-- Homer with an almost empty jar of peanuts, "Boy Scoutz 'N the Hood"

<em>He tips his head back, closes his eyes, opens his mouth, and tosses the
peanut towards his head, missing his mouth.  The peanut clatters behind
the couch, and after a couple of seconds, Homer observes, "Something's
wrong."  He gets down on his hands and knees in front of the couch and
reaches underneath.

-- The voice of reason, "Boy Scoutz 'N the Hood"

<em>"Woo hoo!"  Homer chuckles, and he begins to walk out.  But he trips on
the peanut and lands on his fat can.  The $20 flies out of his hand and
blows out the window.  While "Flight of the Bumblebee" plays in the
background, we follow the course of the money as it blows high over
Springfield.
</em>
<em>In the parking lot of the arcade, Bart and Milhouse take turns punching
one another in the arm.  Both look bored, and Bart says he thinks it's
wearing a bit thin.  "You think so?" queries Milhouse.  Just then, the
$20 lands in the parking lot five feet in front of them, and Milhouse
points it out.  "Maybe a plane exploded," Bart suggests, but Milhouse is
ecstatic: "Our prayers have been answered!"
</em>
<em>The two boys strut into the Kwik-E-Mart.  "Hello gents," Apu says, "what
will it be?"  Milhouse orders a Super Squishy -- "One that's made
entirely out of syrup," Bart adds.  Apu is aghast, as are all the other
customers in the store -- even Snake who holds a bag while he points a
gun at Sanjay.  "An all-syrup Super Squishy?  Oh, s-such a thing has
never been done," Apu explains.  Bart pushes the $20 towards him and
says, "Just make it happen."  Apu complies, with some trepidation.
</em>
<em>He grabs a Super-sized cup and twists the knob on the Squishy machine
from "Recommended Dosage" past "Unhealthy Dosage" to "Experimental".
The machine begins to shake as it ejects goopy green liquid into the
cup.  A man runs out of the store in a panic, and Apu sweats, "She won't
hold!  She's breaking up!"  But the machine dings and stops shaking.
"If you survive, please come again!" he says cordially.
</em>
<em>The boys cheer as they walk out.  Milhouse forces a straw into the
Squishy, commenting how thick it is.  He tries to drink some of it
through the straw, but he sucks the straw into his throat and his
glasses fly off.  Bart doesn't bother with the straw; he simply drinks
straight out of the cup.  "Whoa!  That's good squishy," he smiles, but
then his eyes start to go wonky and he groans.  His vision trebles, and
three Milhouses ask him, "What's it like, Bart?"  Bart can only stutter
incoherently, and Milhouse grabs the Squishy: "Gimme that!"  He takes a
slurp, then groans himself, and his face twitches.
</em>
    <b>Bart: </b>OK, we're young, rich, and full of sugar.  What do we do?

<em>The two young men have a hell of a time: first, they go to the
skateboard park, where a man in a suit shows Bart a skateboard for his
approval.  At the VIP video game room, Milhouse plays two games at once
while a garcon brings him a drink.  The boys go to see "Cats" next, and
Bart mischieviously starts a cat-fight by spitting some Squishy at one
of the actors.  Then, they buy lots of packs of "Toothless Joe"-brand
bubblegum-flavored chewing product and blow immense bubbles with it --
so immense that when the bubbles burst, they are covered with pink
stuff.  Homer happens by, and he sticks his finger in it and licks it
off.  "Mmm, free goo."
</em>
<em>At the 24-hour rub-on tattoo parlor, Bart gets a cobweb and bat on his
right arm and a snake on his left arm, while Milhouse has a woman on his
right arm, a globe on his left arm, and a fiery skull on his torso.  As
they leave, Barney is seen to be walking behind them.

<em>Bart happens upon a crowd of people surrounding a man who is clearly in
pain.  Dr. Hibbert kneels over the man and his diagnosis is that the
man's appendix is about to burst.  "Luckily, I have my trusty pocket-

while Itchy roasts a marshmallow.  It begins to rain and the fire goes
out.  So Itchy grabs some tent pegs and hammers them through Scratch's
feet and hands.  He then puts a stick under Scratchy's stomach to hold
it up, and ties the cat's tongue onto one peg and hammers another
through his tail.  Itchy then lies down under Scratchy's body as though
it was a tent.  Although he is dry, the unfortunate Scratchy gets hit
repeatedly by lightning.

<em>Lisa finds it amusing, but Bart points out an error: "The guys who wrote
this show don't know squat.  Itchy should have tied Scratchy's tongue

</em><em> At 7am, Homer wakes up to falling snow, but is shocked to find that all the

   I've got two words for you:  Mellow out, man.

<em> Barney reluctantly takes a sip.  Then the entire can.  And gradually turns

</em><em>
</em><em> Homer spots Ned and even Adam West letting Barney plow their driveways.
</em><em> Adam West hops into his Batmobile, snaps on his shoulder belt, and with
</em><em> some effort, manages to get his run-down Batmobile (complete with parachute
</em><em> brake) to putter down the street.

</em><em> Homer anxiously waits for the phone to ring.  And it does.  But it's the

<em> News flash:  Barney was caught in an avalanche at Widow's Peak.  The
</em><em> shocking event was captured on film by a FOX camera crew filming ``In
</em><em> Search of Bigfoot.''  The scene of Bigfoot is ruined when the guy in
</em><em> the ape suit forgets to take off his watch before shooting begins.
</em><em> Off to the side is Barney studying a map.  He belches, and the sound
</em><em> induces the avalanche, burying him.  Homer assumes full responsibility
</em><em> and heads out to save his buddy.
</em><em>
</em><em> At the foot of the mountain, Marge makes one last plea for Homer not to
</em><em> go.  Homer assures her, ``This baby is as sure-footed as a mountain goat.''
</em><em> In true sitcom fashion, a faraway mountain goat loses its footing and
</em><em> descends the mountain the painful way.
</em><em>
</em><em> To cross a dangerous chasm, Homer braves a dilapidated rope bridge.
</em><em> Not until he's halfway across does he notice the sturdy modern bridge
</em><em> that runs next to it.
</em><em>
</em><em> Making its way along a precarious ledge, the truck loses its traction
</em><em> and teeters ever-so-precariously over the edge.  Homer carefully turns
</em><em> the radio dial towards the upper end of the dial, and this proves enough
</em><em> to tip the truck back to safety.
</em><em>
</em><em> Barney has resigned himself to his fate, but Homer arrives and rescues
</em><em> him.  The two are reconciled and agree to become partners.  Homer is
</em><em> pleased.  ``When two best friends work together, not even God Himself
</em><em> can stop them.''  A stern voice challenges, ``Oh no?''  The sun suddenly
</em><em> appears, melting the snow.  All of it.
</em>   
   Could this record-breaking heat wave be the result of the dreaded
   ``Greenhouse Effect''?  Well, if 70-degree days in the middle of winter
   are the `price' of car pollution, you'll forgive me if I keep my old Pontiac.
   -- Kent Brockman's Two Cents, ``Mr. Plow''
   
<em> Homer answers the phone:  It's the Repo Depot, calling to distract him
</em><em> while they re-possess his truck.  Which they do.  Marge looks on the
</em><em> bright side.  ``You have your health, you have your best friend back,
</em><em> and... [coyly] you do have that certain special something...''  She
</em><em> means, of course, the Mr. Plow jacket.  Homer fetches the jacket from
</em><em> the closet and makes his own weather prediction:  ``The forecast calls

       he did it, they have Homer's DNA --
 <b>Lisa: </b>They have Simpson DNA!  It could have come from any of us, except

lands nearby and points its beak in a particular direction: "Clue!
Clue!"  Lisa says, "That's it.  Oh, Mr. Pigeon, I'd _kiss_ you if you
weren't swimming with disease!"
</em>
<em>Lisa imagines the time just after Burns got shot in black and white.
She remembers that his gun wasn't in his holster as he staggered toward
the sundial.  As he collapsed, she notes that his hands pointed at W and
S on the compass points -- or, viewed from the back, on M and S. She
gasps: "So the DNA was right!  It must have been -- oh, Dad!"  Lou's
motorcycle speaker crackles, "Attention, all units: Homer Simpson has
been sighted.  Proceed at once to Marvin Monroe Memorial Hospital."  Lou
speeds off, as does Lisa -- and a whole crowd of angry people.  Apu
cautions everyone, "Be careful when we capture him!  We cannot claim the

</em>
<em>Lisa arrives at the hospital first and runs in.  The angry crowd crushes
her bike with their feet on their way in.  Lisa stops in front of the

at them.

<b>Burns: </b>[<i>jovial</i>] Shot?  [<i>chuckles</i>] By you?  I'm afraid not, my primitive

-- The truth revealed, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

<em>Burns goes on to explain over a flashback, "With the sun-blocker in
place and the town aghast, I was on top of the world.  So I wanted to
kick up my heels and indulge my sweet tooth."  In the flashback, Burns
comments how he feels like celebrating.  He spies Maggie in the back of
the Simpson car, smiling.  "Oh, it's you: what are you so happy about?"
She holds up a lollipop.  He gasps and says, "I see."  In the present,
Homer removes a lollipop from his shirt pocket and Burns nods, "Yes...
_that's_ the one."
</em>
<em>He goes on, "Smithers had thwarted my earlier attempt to take candy from
a baby, but with him out of the picture, I was free to wallow in my own
crapulence."  Burns tells Maggie in the flashback to drop the lollipop.
"But the old axiom was misleading: taking the candy proved exceedingly
difficult."  Burns struggles with Maggie, "I said drop it!", and in
doing so, his gun falls out of the holster, into her hands, and
discharges.  In slow motion, both the gun and lollipop fall on the floor
and under the seat.
</em>
<b>Burns: </b>Stricken, I lurched forth in search of aid, but finding only
       slack-jawed gawkers, I gave up and collapsed on the sundial.
 <b>Lisa: </b>Then, with your last ounce of strength, you pointed to W and S...
       or, from your point of view, M and S.
<b>Burns: </b>What?  No!  With my last ounce of strength, I sucked out my gold
       fillings and swallowed them.  Those paramedics have sticky
       fingers.
-- Not if you're a Stonecutter, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

 <b>Marge: </b>Well, I'm just relieved that Homer's safe and that you've

        could talk I'm sure she'd apologize for shooting you.
 <b>Burns: </b>I'm afraid that's insufficient.  Officer: arrest the baby!

   Homer: Marge, could we go in the other room?
          I did something last night I'm not proud of, and I don't want
          the kids to hear it.
   Bart:  Busted!
   Homer: [in the other room, explaining]  I'll work from midnight to eight,
          come home, sleep for five minutes, eat breakfast, sleep six more
          minutes, shower, then I have ten minutes to bask in Lisa's love,
          then I'm off to the power plant, fresh as a daisy.

   on the dairy products!
   -- Apu, ``Lisa's Pony''
   
<em> Homer falls asleep in the doorway, the automatic doors opening and closing
</em><em> on his head.  He drives home and nods off at the wheel.  When we return
</em><em> to reality, we see that the car has driven through a fence, and it
</em><em> careens into the Simpsons garage (taking out the mailbox and the storage
</em><em> shelf in the garage).  A falling circular saw clonks Homer on the head,
</em><em> though it doesn't seem to rouse him from his slumber.  Homer sleepwalks
</em><em> into bed, where the alarm goes off nary a second later.
</em>   
   Marge: Homer, how long do you plan to do this?
   Homer: I don't know.  How long do horses live?
   Marge: Thirty years.
   Homer: D'oh!

<em> Homer leaves for an ``eight hour walk''.  He falls asleep on the car horn.

<em>It's the School District Safety Awards night, and the winner is...
no, that can't be! Not Otto?!
</em>
Wow. You know, most of my life I've... I've had to live with the shame
of being a screw-up. But now, as I stand here with the award for the
district's safest bus driver... well, it... it's like a dream come
true.
-- The fantasies of a bus driver, "Homerpalooza"

<em>Of course it is a dream, as the district's safest bus driver would
never be sleeping on the road, which is what Otto is doing right now.
Milhouse wakes him up just in time to dodge Jasper who is crossing
the street, but abrupt maneuvers send the bus spinning off control
into the auto wrecking yard. With all the professionalism he has,
Otto manages to park the bus right into the car crusher. The kids run
out screaming as the bus is quickly reduced to one tenth of its size.
</em>
So, um... who's good at keeping secrets?
-- Otto, about to design a cover-up, "Homerpalooza"

Dear parents. Due to yesterday's unscheduled field trip to the auto
wrecking yard, the school bus will be out of commission for two weeks.
By reading this letter out loud, you have waived any legal
responsability on our part in perpetuity throughout the universe.
-- Marge reads the school's letter, "Homerpalooza"

<b>Homer:</b> Well, we'll have to organize a car pool. Hey! Every day will be
       like a road trip... with your dad... to school!
 <b>Kids:</b> [<i>groans</i>]
-- This almost sounds exciting, "Homerpalooza"

<em>The next morning, Homer takes the responsability of car pooling Bart,
Lisa, Milhouse, Nelson and Janey. He tries to make the trip fun, but
fails miserably.
</em>
<b>Homer:</b> So... how about those rainbow suspenders, huh?
 <b>Bart:</b> Dad...?
<b>Homer:</b> Pretty cool way to keep your pants up, eh?
 <b>Bart:</b> Dad!
<b>Homer:</b> I see these kids now with "Jive" printed on their shirts.
       Pftt... Now, I can teach you how you're supposed to say "jive".
 <b>Lisa:</b> Dad... Please just drive the car, dad.
<b>Homer:</b> I'm watching the road, sweetie.
       You <b>jive</b> turkey. See? You got to <b>sass</b> it. Quit <b>jivin'</b> me,
       turkey. You got to sass it. A "turkey" is a bad person.
-- On the verge of beating Grampa, "Homerpalooza"

<em>In order to sink even lower, Homer turns on the radio to his favorite
station, which he's the only one in the car to enjoy.
</em>
KFSL -- Fossil 103. Classic hits from Abba to Zeppelin, comma, Led.
-- Never thought I'd miss KBBL, "Homerpalooza"

<em>Milhouse asks Homer to change the radio station, but Homer retorts
that it's Grand Funk Railroad.  No one knows what he's talking about,
and Homer is surprised.
</em>
<em>Homer drops the kids to school, and they rush out of the car.
</em>
For more information on Grand Funk, consult your school library!
-- Homer's word of wisdom, "Homerpalooza"

<em>That afternoon, on the way back, Homer explains to the kids how he
nods his head to the music.
</em>
 <b>Bart:</b> Dad, please, you're embarrassing us.
<b>Homer:</b> No, I'm not.
-- What an argument, "Homerpalooza"

<em>And thus Homer keeps going on and on...
</em>
Grand Funk Railroad paved the way for Jefferson airplane, which cleared
the way for Jefferson starship. The stage was now set for the Alan
Parsons project, which I believe was some sort of hovercraft.
-- Homer, who else, "Homerpalooza"

 <b>Bart:</b> Dad! No one cares about any of your stupid dinosaur bands! You
       have the worst, lamest taste in music ever.
	[<i>turns off the radio</i>]
<b>Homer:</b> I'm just trying to party with you guys.
 <b>Bart:</b> Homer, first of all, it's "par-tay", and second, we wouldn't
       "par-tay" with you if you were the last dad on Earth.
-- "Homerpalooza"

<em>This slap in the face troubles Homer, so he decides to take a walk at
his favorite music store, "Good Vibrations" --later renamed "Suicide
Notes".  He searches for the latest Bread releases and is surprised
when directed to oldies.
</em>
<b>Homer:</b> Now, here are some of your no-name bands. Sonic Youth? Nine Inch
       Nails? Hullabalooza?
<b>Clerk:</b> Hullabalooza is a music festival; the greatest music festival of
       all time.
<b>Homer:</b> There can only be one truly great festival a lifetime and it's
       the "Us Festival".
<b>Clerk:</b> The <b>what</b> festival?
<b>Homer:</b> The "Us Festival"! Geez! It was sponsored by the guy from Apple
       Computers.
<b>Clerk:</b> <b>What</b> computers?
-- You know, the guy with the suit, "Homerpalooza"

<em>Homer walks in the street, dejected.
</em>
Why do you need new bands? Everyone knows rock attained perfection in
1974. It's a scientific fact.
-- Homer, "Homerpalooza"

<em>Flashback to the aforementioned year, where a group of people are
installing a strobe light in a custom van of theirs: "Quadraphonic
sound, a waterbed, and now a strobe light. Gentlemen, say hello to
the second-base mobile." When they resume dancing on "Frankenstein"
with the strobe light on, Homer tries to join in, but fails
miserably.
</em>
<em>"Back then, we didn't care what anyone thought and the chicks found
that irresistible." narrates Homer, as he remembers drinking from the
school fountain as two teen girls walk by. "I think you're <b>cool</b>,
Homer Simpson." affirms one of them, and even if the other one
declares that this remark was mean, Homer takes it as a compliment.
</em>
<em>"But most of all, I remember the music..."  Homer and Barney, in
Homer's room, butcher "You Make Me Feel Like Dancing", when Abe
interrupts them.  "What the hell are you two doing?"  "It's called
rockin' out," replies Barney, and Homer tells Abe he wouldn't
understand 'cause he's not "with it".
</em>
I used to be with it, but then they changed what "it" was. Now, what
I'm with isn't it, and what's "it" seems weird and scary to me.
-- "Homerpalooza"

<em>He warns them, "It'll happen to you."  But teen Homer denies the
undeniable, and looks at the mirror: "We're gonna keep on rockin'
forever... forever... forever..." Fade-in to adult Homer, looking at
his reflection, and realizing those words have lost their meaning.
</em>
<b>Marge:</b> What's wrong, Homie?
<b>Homer:</b> [<i>sighs</i>] I went to the record store today and they were playing
       all that music I've never heard of. It was like the store had
       gone crazy.
<b>Marge:</b> Hmm. Record stores have always seemed crazy to me, but it
       doesn't upset me. Music is none of my business.
-- "Homerpalooza"

<em>"That's fine for you, Marge", Homer says, "but I used to Rock 'N'
Roll all night and party everyday."  Now he finds he has little time
left to get funky.
</em>
I've gotta get out of this rut, and back into the groove.
-- Homer, "Homerpalooza"

<em>Marge asks him to include Bart and Lisa.
</em>
<em>The next morning, Bart and Lisa apprehend another humiliation.
</em>
<b>Bart:</b> Dear Lord, if you keep Homer from embarrassing us today, we
      promise to build several churches in your honor.
<b>Lisa:</b> Bart, no!
-- The price to pay, "Homerpalooza"

<em>Homer passes in front of Milhouse without stopping.
</em>
Hey, wait! I'm okay today! My mom bought me deodorant!
-- Milhouse, "Homerpalooza"

 <b>Lisa:</b> Dad, you forgot to pick up Milhouse.
<b>Homer:</b> [<i>exagerated</i>] I <b>did</b>? I must be getting forgetful in my old age.
       Open the glove compartment and fetch me my brain medicine.
-- This stuff doesn't seem to be working at all, "Homerpalooza"

<em>Lisa doesn't understand the point of all this, but Homer keeps
pointing at the glove compartent. Curious, she opens it, to find...
</em>
<b>Homer:</b> Well? What have we here? Looks like your uncool dad scored
       tickets to Hullabalooza!
 <b>Lisa:</b> [<i>gasps</i>] Bart... these look real...
 <b>Bart:</b> Check the authenticator spot
	[<i>Lisa removes a sticker, which reveals a microchip</i>]
 <b>Chip:</b> This is an authentic Hullabalooza ticket. For authentic
       refreshment, eat Clark bars. And for totally outrageous class
       rings, it's Josten's. Go, Josten's!
-- "Homerpalooza"

You're not going to school today. Today your classroom will be the

</em>
<em>Once they reach Hullabalooza ("Free nose piercing with every
admission"), the kids feel right at home.
</em>
Wow! It's like Woodstock, only with advertisements everywhere and tons
of security guards.
-- Lisa reflects on Hullabalooza, "Homerpalooza"

<em>They get let in, but Homer has to surrender his homemade kahlua.
</em>
 <b>Lisa:</b> Generation X may be shallow but at least they have tolerance and
       respect for all people.
<b>Homer:</b> Hey: a freak show!
-- To a certain extent, "Homerpalooza"

<em>Performers include a bearded woman, a man smoking dozens of
cigarettes at one time, two poodles, and a man able to stick nails in
his nose.  After hitting his finger with the hammer, he presents the
next attraction: Cypress Hill.
</em>
Before we start, we have a lost child here. If she's not claimed within
the next hour, she will become property of Blockbuster Entertainment.
-- A warning from Cypress Hill, "Homerpalooza"

<b>Bart:</b> [<i>sniffing</i>] What is that smell?
<b>Lisa:</b> It smells like Otto's jacket...
-- Which can only mean one thing... "Homerpalooza"

<em>Homer, on his side, is buying some kind of Jamaican hat.
</em>
<b>Clerk:</b> Dude, karma.
<b>Homer:</b> What?
<b>Clerk:</b> [<i>pointing at the hat</i>] Karma, <b>karma</b>.
	[<i>pause</i>]
<b>Homer:</b> [<i>neuter</i>] Oh, I get it. [<i>walks away</i>]
-- But I don't, "Homerpalooza"

<em>Just as Bart and Lisa are starting to appreciate the show, Homer
shows up, wearing this hat of his.
</em>
 <b>Bart:</b> Dad, you cannot wear that! That's a rastafarian hat.
<b>Homer:</b> Pft. Hey, I've been safariing since before you were born.
 <b>Lisa:</b> Wearing a Jamaican hat makes a bold statement about your
       connection to reggae music.
<b>Homer:</b> Well, <b>excuse</b> me.
       [<i>sticks a "Too cool for this planet" sticker to his hat</i>]
 <b>Bart:</b> You know what, dad? Maybe we'll go exploring on our own for a

	[<i>the kids run away</i>]

<em>Left alone, it's time for Homer to get in touch with the young

</em>
<b>Homer:</b> Good concert, am I right?
<b>Teen1:</b> Yeah, nice try, narc.
<b>Teen2:</b> Where's a narc?
<b>Teen3:</b> Who?
<b>Teen1:</b> That fat Jamaican guy.
<b>Homer:</b> What did I say? What's going on?
<b>Teen4:</b> Hey, we're just trying to have a good time, narc. Why do you

<b>Teen5:</b> Don't commit your hate crimes here. [<i>yelling</i>] HATE CRIME!
-- All I did was say "Gimme four more justices", "Homerpalooza"

<em>Thus Homer finds himself on the top of the crowd, being led outside.
</em>
<em>Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa are at the concert listening to Smashing
Pumpkins, where the crowd is  dancing in sort sort of nostalgic
trance.
</em>
<b>Lisa:</b> It may be bleak, but this music is really getting to the crowd.
<b>Bart:</b> Eh, making teenagers depressed is like shooting fish in a barrel.
-- "Homerpalooza"

<em>Homer walks away, disillusioned as always.
</em>
Oh... Makes no sense. I haven't changed since high school and suddenly
I'm uncool.
-- Hand Homer a mirror, "Homerpalooza"

<em>In his rage, Homer kicks a cannon, which goes haywire. After several
bursts, it shoots its bullet right into Homer's stomach. After
bouncing off and falling on the ground, the bullet breaks open,
revealing an inflatable pig, which soars in the sky.
</em>
    <b>Tech:</b> Aw, man. There goes Peter Frampton's big finale. He's gonna
	  be pissed off.
<b>Frampton:</b> You're damn right I'm going to be pissed off; I bought that
	  pig at Pink Floyd's yard sale!
-- Oink oink, "Homerpalooza"

<em>But the crowd is more impressed with Homer's ability to withstand
such a blow without any side effects. Even a manager is impressed:
</em>
Sir, I run Hullabalooza's pageant of the transmundane --the freak show,
and I've been looking for a big fatso to shoot with a cannon. I'd like
very much for you to be that fatso.
-- Hullabalooza's manager wants to hire Homer, "Homerpalooza"

<em>Homer is flattered, but Marge doesn't take it the same way.
</em>

<b>Homer:</b> I don't think I have a choice, Marge.
<b>Marge:</b> Of course you have a choice.
<b>Homer:</b> How do you figure?
<b>Marge:</b> You don't have to join a freak show just because the opportunity
       came along.
<b>Homer:</b> You know, Marge, in some ways, you and I are very different
       people.
-- After all these years, he finds out, "Homerpalooza"

<em>As you could've guessed, Homer stuck with his idea, and is about to
be shot on stage for the first time ever.
</em>
[<i>in a shy, nervous tone</i>] Hi everybody. Is everybody... good?
-- Homer is about to begin his number, "Homerpalooza"

<em>Homer puts on his safety glasses, takes place in front of the cannon,
and receives the bullet right in the stomach. He quickly gets up,
though, and is acclaimed by the crowd.
</em>
<em>In backstage, Homer autographs a cannon ball: "Stay in school, your
hero, Homer". The kid takes the ball, but is instantly crushed by it.
</em>
<b>Corgan:</b> Hey cannonball, I like your statement: when life takes a cheap
	shot at you, you stand your ground. Billy Corgan, Smashing
	Pumpkins.
 <b>Homer:</b> Homer Simpson, smiling politely.
-- That's not a band!, "Homerpalooza"

 <b>Homer:</b> You know, my kids think you're the greatest. And thanks to your

<b>Corgan:</b> Well, we try to make a difference.
-- Positive differences, check with Barry Manilow, "Homerpalooza"

<em>At school, Bart reads a letter from his father.  "Dear Bart and Lisa.

crossing.  They turn left for Cleveland, then back and right for
Cincinnati, then they change their minds and turn back home.
</em>
<em>"Our first job is to entertain."  Homer gets shot with a cannon, with
cheering from the crowd.  "And I like to think sometimes we get a
message across as well."  Same thing, but this time Homer has "No
Litter" written on his stomach before he gets shot.
</em>
<em>"But the main thing is: I've finally tapped into that spirit of self-
destruction that makes Rock 'N' Roll the king of music."  Everyone on
the bus is cheering Homer, who's "water-skiing" with the bus, only
with frying pans instead of skis.  Cypress Hill throws cans at him.
Homer yells "Woo-hoo!"
</em>
<em>And the tour keeps going on, with a huge success.
</em>
<b>Teen1:</b> Oh, here comes that cannonball guy. He's cool.
<b>Teen2:</b> Are you being sarcastic, dude?

Thank you! And remember, don't trust anyone over 30! And now, Peter
Frampton!
-- Homer, after his number, "Homerpalooza"

<b>Corgan:</b> Hey, Homer, looks like our next stop is your hometown,
	Springfield.
<b>D'Arcy:</b> Is it true that we have to bring our own water?
 <b>Homer:</b> We got a little rule back home: if it's brown, drink it down;
	if it's black, send it back.
-- Springfield, still a national proudness, "Homerpalooza"

<b>Chamberlin:</b> The hometown show's the big one, Homer.
       <b>Iha:</b> Yeah, people who called you a weirdo in high school get to
	    see what a successful freak you've become.
	    [<i>points to D'Arcy</i>]
    <b>D'Arcy:</b> Hey, I wasn't a weirdo. I was in the audio-visual club.
     <b>Homer:</b> Really? Me too! But I got kicked out 'cause of my views of
	    Vietnam. Also, I was stealing projectors.
-- Also because I didn't know what I was doing, "Homerpalooza"

<em>When Homer drinks beer to celebrate, though, his stomach echoes when
he burps.  The manager, worried, slaps his stomach and the same

Homer, nothing's more important to me than the health and well-being of
my freaks. I'm sending you to a vet.
-- Hullabalooza manager, "Homerpalooza"

<em>The veterinarian diagnoses that the cannonballs have demolished
Homer's stomach.  Among other things, he strongly encourages Homer
not to get hit by another cannonball.
</em>
<b>Homer:</b> Pftt... Rules. I'm a rocker, I don't care for rules.
  <b>Vet:</b> Mr. Simpson, this is serious. If you take one more cannonball to
       the gut, you will die.
<b>Homer:</b> Die? Well, you don't scare me, doc, 'cause dying would be a

<em>Homer wonders why all those questions, but Bart avoids the subject by
saying it's "just some report [<i>he's</i>] gotta do for school", and offers
him a piece of pie. While he's away, Homer takes a look at Bart's

<em> Mayor `Diamond' Joe Quimby inaugurates the new Nuclear Disaster Warning Sign
</em><em> which contains the caption `Nuclear Plant Conditions' atop an electronic
</em><em> billboard.
</em>   
   Diamond Joe Quimby:  Chief Wiggum, Archbishop McGee, distinguished guests,
          I am pleased to dedicate this emergency warning system.  In the
          off-chance of a nuclear disaster, this sign will tell you, the
          good citizens of Springfield, what to do!
          [sign lights up, ``Relax.  Everything is fine.'']
   Crowd: Aah. [applause]
          [sign lights up, ``Minor leak.  Roll up window.'']
   Crowd: Ooh. [mild applause]
          [sign lights up, ``Meltdown.  Flee city.'']
   Crowd: [scattered applause]
          [sign lights up, ``Core explosion.  Repent sins.'']
   Crowd: [stunned silence]
   Homer: Hee hee.  Joke's on them.  If the core explodes, there won't be any
          power to light that sign!
   -- Homer jokes with his coworkers about the Nuclear Disaster Warning Sign,
      ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> But Burns isn't present.  Smithers finds Burns flat on his back.
</em>   
   No quack sawbones is going to apply his leeches to me.  As long as there's
   an ounce of strength left in me, I... [passes out]
   -- Monty Burns collapses from hypohemia, ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> Dr. Hibert diagnoses Burns with hypohemia.  Smithers offers his own blood,
</em><em> but he's the wrong blood type.
</em>   
   Smithers, don't feel so bad.  After all, that kidney you donated to me
   really hit the spot.
   -- Burns, consoling Smithers, who is unable to give the blood necessary
      to save his life, ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> When Smithers announces Burns' situation over the company PA system, nobody
</em><em> wants to help, and Homer scolds them.
</em>   
   I can't believe you guys.  There's a human being out there with millions
   of dollars who needs our help.  And you don't want to cash in?
   -- Homer tries to take the moral high ground when none of his coworkers
      wants to donate blood to save Mr. Burns, ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> At home, Lisa shows Maggie flashcards with exotic animals like the lemur
</em><em> and zebu.
</em>   
   [showing Maggie flashcards] Maggie, look!  What's that?  Lemur.
   [slowly]  Le-mur.  [next card]   Zebu.  [slowly]  Ze-bu.
   -- Lisa tries to enlighten Maggie, ``Blood Feud''
   
   Marge: [watching Lisa show Maggie flashcards] What's a zebu?
   Lisa:  It's like an ox, only it has a hump and a dewlap.
          [indicating to Maggie]  [sweetly] Hump, and a dewlap!  Hump and dewlap!
   -- Lisa shows Maggie animal flashcards, ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> Homer comes in and asks Marge what his blood type is.  Marge impresses the
</em><em> family with her knowledge of everything about them, and mentions that Bart
</em><em> has the rare double O negative that Mr. Burns needs.  Bart refuses to give
</em><em> his blood, but Marge tells him it's the right thing to do.  And Homer tells
</em><em> Bart he'll be showered with gifts if he does...
</em>   
   Homer: Don't you know the story of Hercules and the lion?
   Bart:  Is it a Bible story?
   Homer: Yeah, probably.  Anyway, once upon a time, there was a big mean lion
          who got a thorn in his paw.  All the village people tried to pull it
          out, but nobody was strong enough!  So, they got Hercules.  And
          Hercules used his mighty strength, and Bingo!  Anyway, the moral is,
          the lion was so happy, he gave Hercules this big... thing... of riches.
   Bart:  How did a lion get rich?
   Homer: It was the olden days!
   Bart:  Oh.
   -- ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> The next day, Homer takes Bart to the Bloodmobile to donate the blood.
</em><em> The blood is rushed to the hospital, sort of.  As the blood transfusion
</em><em> is made...
</em>   
   Burns:    [weakly] Smithers, I'm not going to make it.  I want to
             dictate my epitaph.
   Smithers: [choked with tears] Go ahead.
   Burns:    Charles Montgomery Burns.  ... American...  Patriot... American...
             Patriot...  [gaining energy] Master of the atom. ... Scourge
             of the despot!  [really on a roll] Oh, tyrant!  Hear his
             mighty name, and quake! [gets up]  Smithers, I'm back!
   -- Burns receives a badly-needed transfusion, ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> Burns arrives at work, bright and cheery.
</em>   
   Burns: Oh, top of the morning to ye!  Why, look who's here!
          It's ... good old... You!
   Man:   Hi, Mr. Burns.
   Burns: Oh, hey there, Mr. uh... Brown-Shoes!  How about that ..
          local sports team!
   -- Mr. Burns is full of energy after his transfusion, ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> Burns also beats his opponent at jai alai.
</em>   
   Smithers, I'm back in the pink!  Full of pith and vinegar!
   -- Mr. Burns is full of energy after his transfusion, ``Blood Feud''
   
   You know, it's funny, Smithers.  I tried every tincture and poultice and
   tonic and patent medicine there is, and all I really needed was the blood
   of a young boy.
   -- Mr. Burns is full of energy after his transfusion, ``Blood Feud''
   
   Burns:    By the way, what was the lad's name?
   Smithers: Uh, Bart Simpson, sir.
   Burns:    Who?
   Smithers: He's the son of Homer Simpson, sir.  One of your stiffs
             in sector 7-G.
   -- Burns leans who donated the blood to save his life, `Blood Feud''
   
<em> Burns says Bart will be receiving a surprise in the mail.  At home...
</em>   
   Bill.     [tosses into wastebasket]
   Bill.     [tosses into wastebasket]
   Summons.  [tosses into wastebasket]
   Bill.     [tosses into wastebasket]
   -- Homer goes through the daily mail, ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> He then finds a letter from Burns.
</em>   
   Homer: Marge, Lisa, Maggie, let's do this out in the yard where the neighbors
          can see.  Lisa, dim the lights.  No, turn on more lights.  Oh, do
          something!
   Lisa:  Yes, Dad. [turns on the sprinkler]
   -- Homer prepares to open the letter from Mr. Burns, ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> But it's just a card that reads, ``Dear Bart, thank you kindly for the
</em><em> blood.  Yours truly, Montgomery Burns.''  Lisa turns off the sprinkler.
</em>   
   Some way to show your gratitude!  No gold, no diamonds, no rubies, not even
   a lousy card!  Wait a minute... there &lt;was&gt; a card...
   -- Homer is mad at Mr. Burns, whose only expression of gratitude was a
      thank-you card, ``Blood Feud''
   
   Marge: Homer, you don't do things like that to be rewarded.  You do
          them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand.
   Homer: Marge, you're my wife, I love you very much, but [condescendingly]
          you're living in a world of make-believe!  With flowers and bells
          and leprechauns and magic frogs with funny little hats.
   Bart: Yeah, Mom, we got hosed.
   -- When Bart saves Mr. Burns' life with his donated blood, ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> But Homer is mad because he promised Bart lots of riches.
</em>   
   Homer: Bart!  Take a letter!
          Dear Mr. Burns...  [heavy sarcasm] I'm so `glad' you enjoyed my
          son's blood.  And your `card' was `just great'.  In case you can't
          tell, I'm being sarcastic.  You.. Stink!  Could you read that last
          part back to me?
   Bart:  `You stink!'
   Homer: Heh heh heh.  Good.  `You are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy,
          with bony girl-arms, and you smell like...'
   Bart:  An elephant's butt?
   Homer: Hee hee.  `An elephant's butt.'
   -- Homer writes a nasty letter to his boss, ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> Homer is about to mail the letter, but Marge convinces him to sleep on it.
</em><em> Homer's dream defies description.  The next morning, Homer thanks Marge
</em><em> for stopping him.  We see Bart walking down to the corner mailbox and
</em><em> putting the letter in.
</em><em>
</em><em> [End of Act 1.  Time: 9:35]
</em><em>
</em><em> Homer turns the house upside-down to find the letter, then learns Bart
</em><em> mailed the letter.  Homer attacks Bart, but Marge scolds him.  ``You
</em><em> should be strangling yourself.''  Homer and Bart try to retrieve the
</em><em> letter from the mailbox, with no success.
</em>   
   I'm with you, Homer!  Fight the Power!
   -- Barney provides encouragement as Homer kicks the mailbox, ``Blood Feud''
   
   Homer: I'll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will
          be able to read it!
   Bart:  Yeah, but don't other people have mail in there?
   Homer: So a few people won't get a few letters, boo hoo!
          You know the kind of letters people write. ``Dear somebody you've
          never heard of, How is so-and-so?  Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.
          Yours truly, some bozo.''  Big loss.
   -- On watering the mail to prevent a letter from being mailed, ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> Before Homer can execute his plan, he's caught.
</em>   
   Homer: I guess it wouldn't do any good to run 'cause you're a mail-lady and you
          know my name and address and everything, huh?
   Postal Worker: That's right.
   Homer: Well.. I'm still going to run. [runs away]
   -- Homer is caught tampering with a mailbox, ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> Meanwhile, Burns hires a ghost writer to help him write his story of his
</em><em> hypohemia incident.
</em>   
   Mr. Roman: First question.  Have you slept with anyone famous?
   Burns: Well, Countess von Zeppelin and I...  [catches himself] What in blazes!
   -- Burns hires a ghost writer, ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> Burns decides to write it himself.  Homer goes to the post office pretending
</em><em> to be Mr. Burns...
</em>   
   Homer: [trying to disguise his voice]
          Hello, my name is Mr. Burns.  I believe you have a letter for me.
   Postal Clerk: Okay, Mr. Burns, uh, what's your first name?
   Homer: [brief pause] I don't know.
          [outside on the steps of the post office] Great plan, Bart.
   -- Trying to intercept a letter, ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> Back at the house...
</em>   
   Lisa:  Ooh, look, Maggie!  What is that?  Dodecahedron!  Dodecahedron!
   Homer: Lisa, I don't know what you're doing, but it's very strange, and
          your father is trying to worry.
   -- Lisa shows Maggie some very peculiar flashcards, ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> Burns continues writing his book as Homer sneaks into Burns' office
</em><em> to steal the letter.  Burns finds him...
</em>   
   Burns:  Who are you?
   Homer:  [thinks] Don't tell him.  Give him a fake name.
           [aloud]  Homer Simpson.
           [thinks] D'oh!
   -- Thinking fast on your feet, ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> ... and opens the letter.  Homer is taken away.
</em>   
   I could crush him like an ant.  But it would be too easy.  No, revenge is
   a dish best served cold.  I'll bide my time until...  Oh, what the hell.
   I'll just crush him like an ant.
   -- Burns plans his next move, ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> [End of Act 2.  Time: 14:09]
</em><em>
</em><em> Burns tells Smithers to have Homer beaten to a pulp.  Back at home,
</em><em> Homer bemoans his fate.
</em>   
   Bart: You always told me I was going to destroy the family.  But I never
         believed it.
   Lisa: That's okay, Bart.  Nobody really believed it.
         We were just trying to scare you.
   -- Bart destroys the family, ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> An unshaven Smithers tries to tell Joe to beat up Homer, but can't do it.
</em><em> Meanwhile, Burns finishes up his book...
</em>   
   In closing, gentle reader, I'd like to thank you.
   `What's that?' you say?  Me thanking you?
   No, it's not a misprint, for you see, I enjoyed writing this book as much
   as you enjoyed reading it.  The End.
   -- Burns finishes his book, ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> Smithers comes in and says he didn't order the beating, since after all,
</em><em> Homer saved his life.  Burns is won over.  At Moe's Tavern, Homer
</em><em> drowns his sorrows in drink.
</em>   
   Moe:  [answers the phone]  Moe's Tavern, where the elite meet to drink.
   Bart: Uh, hello.  Is Mike there?  Last name, Rotch.
   Moe:  Hold on, I'll check. [calls]  Mike Rotch!  Mike Rotch!  Hey, has
         anybody seen Mike Rotch lately? [snickers from the patrons]
         [to phone] Listen, you little puke.  One of these days, I'm going
         to catch you, and I'm going to carve my name on your back with
         an ice pick.
   -- Another phone prank, ``Blood Feud''
   
   Moe:    What's the matter, Homer?  You're not your normal effervescent self.
   Homer:  I got my problems, Moe.  Give me another one.
   Moe:    Homer, hey.  You should not drink to forget your problems.
   Barney: Yeah.  You should only drink to enhance your social skills. [belch]
   -- But does it work? ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> Burns decides...
</em>   
   We'll get the Simpsons a present.  An extravagant present.  A mad, unthinkable,
   utterly impossible present!  A frabulous, grabulous, zip-zoop-zabulous present!
   -- Monty Burns meets Dr. Seuss? ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> After much searching, he finds it, for $32,000.  A huge crate is delivered to
</em><em> the Simpsons residence, and Burns gives Homer an advance copy of his
</em><em> book, ``Will There Ever Be a Rainbow?''
</em>   
   Burns: Hello, young fellow.  I haven't forgotten you.  Here.
   Bart:  Wow, a crowbar!
   Lisa:  It's to open the crate, stupid.
   -- Burns gives the Simpsons a gift, ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> It's a 3000-year-old carved head of Xtapolapocetl [I definitely spelled
</em><em> it wrong, but I can't find it in my dictionary].
</em>   
   Maggie: [holds up an `Aztec' flashcard]
   Lisa:   No, Maggie.  Not Aztec, Olmec.  [slowly]  Ol-mec.
   Maggie: [falls down]
   -- Lisa tries to enlighten Maggie, ``Blood Feud''
   
<em> Burns leaves.  The family eat dinner on TV dinner trays, watching the
</em><em> giant head do nothing.
</em>   
   Homer: Save a guy's life, and what do you get?  Nothing!  Worse than nothing!
          Just a big scary rock.
   Bart:  Hey, man, don't bad-mouth the head.
   Marge: Homer, it's the thought that counts.  The moral of the story is a
          good deed is its own reward.
   Bart:  Hey, we &lt;got&gt; a reward.  The head is cool.
   Marge: Then... I guess the moral is no good deed goes unrewarded.
   Homer: Wait a minute.  If I hadn't written that nasty letter, we wouldn't've
          gotten anything.
   Marge: Well... Then I guess the moral is the squeaky wheel gets the grease.
   Lisa:  Perhaps there is no moral to this story.
   Homer: Exactly!  Just a bunch of stuff that happened.
   Marge: But it certainly was a memorable few days.
   Homer: Amen to that!
          [laughter all around]
   -- We don't need no steenkin' morals, ``Blood Feud''

% Bkgd = background singers
%
% Marge, Homer, Lisa and Maggie walk past the sign on the Springfield
% Elementary lawn:  ``Fourth Grade Dance Recital, Tonight 7:30''
% Leaning coolly against the sign are three hiply-dressed boys.  Homer
% is in a blue suit, Lisa in her pink gown; Marge and Maggie are
% traditionally dressed.  The family head up the walk to the main entrance,
% joining many other parents doing the same.  Lisa doesn't look too happy.
%
% Marge and Homer take their seats.  Push in on the closed curtain.

Bart: [o.s.] Come on, man!  I can't wait!  I &lt;love&gt; an audience!

% From behind the curtain pokes Bart's head, an arm, and a leg.  The three
% rise in unison up off the floor.  Cut to backstage, where we see that
% Richard and Milhouse are holding Bart up off the ground.

Milhouse: Ugh!  I'm hurting, Bart!

% A green-sleeved arm yanks Bart away.

Ms.K: Bart!

% Ms. Krabappel carries Bart across the stage and sets him down behind
% the inner curtain.

Ms.K: Don't worry, Bart.  I'll tell your parents you took part.

% She leaves.

Bart: [moans]

% The curtain opens to polite applause.

Pr.S: [o.s.] Now, a group that needs no introduction:  Your children.

% A scratchy record plays, and the kids dance stodgily in unison.
% From behind the crowd, Bart rises on his tiptoes and jumps.  His
% head becomes briefly visible as he reaches the apex of each jump.

Bart: [jump] Mom!
[jump] Homer!
[jump] Mom!
[jump] Homer!

% Pull back to reveal Marge and Homer.

Marge: Where's Bart?
Homer: I dunno.

% Backstage, Bart grimaces, then gets a sly grin.  He reaches into his
% jacket and produces a personal stereo.  He goes to the reel-to-reel
% tape deck and shuts it off, with the accompanying ``Huh?''s from the
% audience.  He then plugs the audio system into his portable tape deck.
% Funky music issues forth.  Ms. Krabappel and Principal Skinner do a
% double-take.  The kids look at each other, then to Ms. Krabappel, who
% whispers...

Ms.K: [whispers]  Keep going!  Keep going!

% The kids shrug and continue their stodgy dance routine.  In the audience,
% the parents look at each other as if to say, ``Is this supposed to happen?''
%
% Bart's head slowly works its way through the crowd as Bart hums softly to
% himself.  A fist is raised high.

Bart: Yo!

% Bart pushes through and earns a spotlight.  The kids stop their dancing.

Bart:      Hey, what's happening, dude?
I'm the guy with the rep for being rude.

% Marge, Lisa, Homer and Maggie watch, shocked.

Bart: Terrorizing people wherever I go,
It's not intentional, just keepin' the flow.

% Bart takes off his jacket and GQ-ly drapes it over his shoulder.

Bart:   Fixin' test scores to get the best scores.

% Bart tosses his jacket offstage, hitting Principal Skinner squarely in
% the face.

Bart:   Droppin' banana peels all over the floor.

% Skinner rushes for a filing cabinet and flips through it frantically.

Bart:   I'm the kid that made delinquency an art,

% He finds Bart's disciplinary file.

Bart:   Last name Simpson, first name Bart.

% Maggie sucks in time.

Bart:   I'm here today to introduce the next phase,
The next step in the big Bart craze.

% Bart does a sort-of moonwalk, except he goes nowhere.  A crook slowly
% approaches from behind...

Bart:   I've got a dance real easy to do.
I learned it with no rhythm, and so can you.

% Bart ducks in time as the crook is yanked hard.  Cut to Principal Skinner
% holding the crook; next to him stands Ms. Krabappel, who snaps her finger
% in frustration.

Bart:   So move your body if you've got the notion,
Front to back in a rock-like motion.
Now that you've got it, if you think you can,
Homer:                                                D'oh!

% Flash!  Thank you very much.
%
% Bart walks dejectedly down a black-and-white corridor as shadows of

Bart:   Sitting by myself, confined to my room.

% Bart enters the room at the end of the hallway.  Iron bars close behind

%
% Bart lies, face down, on his bed, hardly happy.

Bart:   When all else fails, nothin' else left to do,
I turn on the music, so I can feel the groove.

   Simpson!  Homer Simpson!

</em>   
   TOXIC WASTE -- DO NOT EAT.
   -- Warning labels save lives, ``Marge vs. the Monorail''
   
<em> The two wonder where the waste gets taken.  Carl figures it's buried in
</em><em> an abandoned chalk mine.  Lenny thinks it's sent to a Southern state

</em><em> the barrel away.
</em>   
   Smithers: Well, sir, where should we dump &lt;this&gt; batch [of nuclear waste]?

   Burns:    No.  All those bald children are arousing suspicion.
   -- Monty's kids, ``Marge vs. the Monorail''
   
<em> At the park, Burns tries to shove another barrel into a hollowed-out tree.
</em><em> ``The last tree held nine drums!''  He indicates another tree stuffed
</em><em> with radioactive waste, glowing green, complete with purple tentacles
</em><em> and really scary squirrels.  Burns' nighttime undertaking is interrupted
</em><em> by EPA agents.
</em><em>
</em><em> In court (``Liberty and Justice for Most''), Burns is fined $3 million,
</em><em> which he pays.  On the spot.  In cash.
</em>   
   Heh heh heh.  Oh, Andy Capp.  You wife-beating drunk.  Heh heh heh.
   -- Homer reads the funnies, ``Marge vs. the Monorail''
   
<em> There will be a town meeting to decide how to spend the $3 million.
</em><em> Lisa dreams of spending it on the public schools.  Bart's dream
</em><em> is also vaguely school-related.  Marge thinks the money should be
</em><em> spent on something the whole town should be proud of.
</em><em>
</em><em> While everyone else is at Springfield Town Hall, Snake and his pals
</em><em> rob their homes.

   Quimby: We will now hear suggestions for the disbursement of the
           two million dollars.

<em> Mr. Lanley takes his spiel to Lisa's class, where he answers questions

<em> Otto asks who gets to be conductor.  Lanley consults his notebook
</em><em> (in which he has drawn a picture of himself driving to Tahiti with
</em><em> a pickup full of cash) and arbitrarily selects Homer as the monorail
</em><em> conductor.
</em><em>
</em><em> While Homer shows off the steering compartment of the monorail, Marge
</em><em> finds an opossum family in the fire extinguisher compartment.  (No
</em><em> fire extinguisher is to be seen.)
</em><em>
</em><em> Marge goes to visit Mr. Lanley's office and, finding no one inside,
</em><em> lets herself in.  There, she finds Lanley's notebook.  She is startled
</em><em> by the appearance of Mr. Lanley.  ``How much did you see?''  ``Um,
</em><em> nothing incriminating.''  Lanley's demeanor brightens.  ``Good!''
</em><em> Marge quickly excuses herself.
</em><em>
</em><em> She drives to North Haverbrook, ``Where the monorail is king!'',
</em><em> claims the billboard.  It is a run-down town, where the locals are
</em><em> reluctant to discuss the monorail.  She is startled by Sebastian
</em><em> Cobb, whom Lanley hired to build the monorail.  He shows her what's
</em><em> left of it.  When asked what can be done, he answers, ``You just better

</em><em>
</em><em> Homer (dressed in a bizarre uniform) fires up the engines and disengages

</em><em>
</em><em> The Seld-M-Break hose finally snaps, and the train accelerates out of

<em> To resolve the constitutional crisis, the two go to town hall.

</em><em>
</em><em> One technician suggests cutting the power, but alas, the monorail

<em> Marge calls Homer on the radio.  Mr. Cobb tells Homer to find an anchor
</em><em> of some sort.  Homer looks at Bart and envisions him as an anchor.
</em><em> ``Think harder, Homer.''  Homer takes a lariat from a passenger, ties it
</em><em> to the metal `M' from the monorail sign and heaves it overboard.  Bart
</em><em> reminds him that he should tie the loose end of the rope to the train.
</em><em> The `M' anchor rips into the ground, destroying everything in its
</em><em> path.  It chops down Springfield's Tallest Tree, sending it crashing
</em><em> onto Jebediah Springfield's Birthplace.  Dr. Hibbert explains to
</em><em> Siamese twins that an operation to separate them is a long and
</em><em> costly procedure.  The anchor rope rips through them, separating
</em><em> them cleanly.  The makeshift anchor passes in front of ``Ye Olde
</em><em> Anchor Shoppe'', owned by Captain McAlister.  (``You call that an
</em><em> anchor?'')  It eventually hooks onto a giant donut atop a donut shop
</em><em> and brings the train to a stop.

       Marge, I have some horrible, bone-chilling news!
<b>Marge: </b>[<i>gasps</i>] What is it?
 <b>Bart: </b>Hi, Homer.
<b>Homer: </b>Oh...nothing.
-- Crisis averted, everything is super, "Bart Gets Famous"

 <b>Bart: </b>Hey, that's my lucky red hat sitting on top of a double-
       corrugated, eight-fold, fourteen-gauge box!
<b>Marge: </b>Oh, it sounds like you really learned something on your field
       trip.  Think you'd be interested in a career as a box maker?
 <b>Bart: </b>Well, that'll always be the dream...

<em>Bart then tells Marge he's got a job in the show business, helping
Krusty the Klown after school.

<b>Marge: </b>Hmm, I don't know, Bart.  You're only ten.
 <b>Lisa: </b>I've got a weekend job helping the poor and I'm only eight.
<b>Homer: </b>[<i>scoffs</i>] That's not a job, it's a waste of time.  What can poor
       people pay you?  Nothing!  What satisfaction you get from helping
       them?  None!  Who wants to help poor people anyway?  Nobody!
        [<i>Marge, Lisa, and Bart stare at him</i>]
 <b>Bart: </b>So, anyway...
-- Homer the Generous, "Bart Gets Famous"

    <b>Bart: </b>Can I, Mom?  Can I take the job?
   <b>Marge: </b>Well --

           [<i>The monkey does so, and Homer falls over and screams</i>]
          Yes, son, you can have an electric guitar just like your old
          man.
    <b>Bart: </b>Dad, I'm asking if I can get a job.
   <b>Homer: </b>[<i>condescending</i>] Gig, son.  When you're a musician, a job is
          called a "gig".

<b>Homer: </b>It's OK, son.  Who cares what a bunch of fourth-graders think?
       You're doing what _you_ want to do with your life.  Nothing else
       matters.
 <b>Bart: </b>[<i>grateful</i>] Thanks, Dad.  That's great advice.

<em>At the Monstro Mart, Krusty is signing autographs.  Well, actually, he
sits on a stool smoking, and _Bart_ signs the autographs.  When a little
girl asks Krusty to sign her picture, he points her towards a long line
of children, at the head of which Bart sits at a table writing "KRUSTY"
in pencil on photos of the klown.  Bart groans, and the girl calls out,
"I love you, Krusty!"

  <b>Bart: </b>[<i>tired</i>] Yes, Krusty?
<b>Krusty: </b>Bart, I need to get your fingerprints on a candlestick.  Meet me

        be aaaall right.
  <b>Bart: </b>Oh, I wish I was dead.
-- You may get your wish soon, "Bart Gets Famous"

<em>After school, Bart hands out food to the cast of Krusty's show.

 <b>Mel: </b>[<i>spits out food</i>] Pah!  There's cheese in this sandwich.  Surely
      you know I'm lactose-intolerant?
<b>Bart: </b>[<i>bored</i>] Sorry.
 <b>Mel: </b>Sorry?  Do you know how sick this is going to make me?  [<i>groans</i>]
      Oh, boy.  Come and stand next to the bathroom door; I want to yell
      at you some more.
-- Bart, scapegoat for abuse, "Bart Gets Famous"

<em>Sideshow Mel rants at Bart, but soon the boy finds it tiresome.  "Show
business sucks," he says, walking dejectedly towards the exit.
</em>
<b>Krusty: </b>Bart!  I need to use you in a sketch.
  <b>Bart: </b>You want me to be on the show?
<b>Krusty: </b>It's just one line.  Mel's supposed to say it, but he's dead.
  <b>Bart: </b>Dead?
<b>Krusty: </b>Or sick, I dunno.  I forget.  Anyway, all you gotta do is say,
        "I am waiting for a bus."  Then I hit you with pies for five
        minutes.  Got that?
  <b>Bart: </b>"I am waiting for a bus."
<b>Krusty: </b>Makes _me_ laugh.  Let's go!
-- Humor for the masses, "Bart Gets Famous"

<em>On a set taken from the early 1900s, a mustached Krusty stands next to a
pie cart.  He motions for a mustached Bart to walk in, which Bart does.
"I am waiting for a -- whoa!"  Bart says, bumping into a prop.  He
knocks over a couple more props, and then the backdrop starts to shake.
It falls off its support, dragging a couple of spotlights with it.  Bart
excuses himself hurriedly with "I didn't do it."  Everyone in the
audience starts to laugh and clap as Bart looks around in amazement.
</em>
<b>Krusty: </b>Oh, man.  It's a miracle we got through that one.  Remind me
        never to let you on stage again, kid.  Some people got it, some
        people don't, and _you_, my young friend, do not have -- hold
        on, I want to finish this thought outside --

   <b>Man: </b>It's the "I didn't do it" guy!
         [<i>Krusty looks shocked</i>]

</em>
<em>A screen introduces "The 'I Didn't Do It' Boy In: The Ming Vase On
Ladder Sketch", showing a picture of a smiling Bart.  Krusty says, "Why,
this rickety ladder in front of this door is the _perfect_ place for
this priceless Ming vase."  He then steps back, pointing at the vase and
grinning.  Bart walks in, knocking the ladder over and smashing the
vase.  "I didn't do it," he says, and the audience laugh and cheer.
"Thank you, thank you," says Krusty, then introducing "the 'I Didn't Do
It' Dancers!"  Four women begin dancing to a techno-pop song.

<em>Diamond Joe Quimby lies in bed with a woman, giggling.  His wife opens
the door, and the woman screams.  "Joe, how could you?" she asks, hurt,
and Joe says, "I, er, didn't do it."  The three of them begin to laugh.

the man who's life is in danger.}
</em>
<em>At breakfast the next day, everyone holds "I Didn't Do It: the Bart
Simpson Story."

 <b>Lisa: </b>This biography of Bart came out awfully quickly.  It's not even
       about him!
 <b>Bart: </b>Sure it is!  Look at the cover.
 <b>Lisa: </b>But inside it's mostly about Ross Perot, and the last two
       chapters are excerpts from the Oliver North trial.

-- That's _Senator_ Oliver North, almost, "Bart Gets Famous"

<em>In the recording studio, the background to Rick James' "Superfreak"
plays, and Bart raps "I didn't do it" a la Hammer.  The latter watches
from the control room, and he says, "Hey, proper," with admiration.
Bart's "I Didn't Do It III" album comes out, and it sells very quickly.
</em>
<em>Krusty even organizes a "See the 'I Didn't Do It' Boy" event where, for
a mere five dollars, one gets to go in a tent and see Bart sitting on a
chair.

<b>Homer: </b>Come on, Lisa, say something funny.
        [<i>holds a tape recorded with a microphone</i>]
 <b>Lisa: </b>Like what?
<b>Homer: </b>Oh, something stupid like Bart would say.  "Bucka Bucka" or
       "Woozle Wuzzle": something like that.
 <b>Lisa: </b>Forget it, Dad.  If I ever become famous, I want it to be for
       something worthwhile, not because of some obnoxious fad.
 <b>Bart: </b>Obnoxious fad?

       intelligent stuff to talk about.
<b>Homer: </b>Don't forget to say "I didn't do it."
 <b>Bart: </b>Dad, there's more to me than just a catch-phrase.
<b>Homer: </b>How do you figure, boy?
 <b>Bart: </b>Watch "The Conan O'Brien Show", you'll see.
<b>Homer: </b>All right, but after Leno I'm all laughed out, you know.

<em>On "Late Night with Conan O'Brien", Bart tries to talk to the host.

<em>Bart and Lisa watch an Itchy and Scratchy episode, "The Last Traction
Hero".  Scratchy works out with a large dumbbell; after three overhead
lifts, his entire upper body becomes huge and muscular.  He flexes a
bit, proud, then walk over to Itchy menacingly.  Upon seeing him flex
his biceps and chest, Itchy thinks for a moment, then smiles and pulls
out a pink balloon and a pin.  He bursts the balloon, then pokes
Scratchy in the chest, hoping for the same result, but all that happens
is that a drop of blood leaks out.  Scratchy laughs evilly, but Itchy
pokes many holes in his upper torso in rapid succession.  This, too,
seems to have no effect, and Scratchy laughs again, but as the blood
leaks out from all the pinpricks, Scratchy feels weak and sits down on a
bench to rest.  Itchy brandishes a chainsaw and slices off the cat's
bicep and chest muscles.

runs a chainsaw.  Bart and Lisa smile as they watch.

<em>An Itchy and Scratchy robot pair walk next to each other and hit each
other with mallets; blood even flies from their heads.  Another pair
shoot each other repeatedly with short bursts from a machine gun.  The

mind -- rather, they seem to be enjoying it.  "Wow," gasps Bart, "this

around on its roller, followed by some marching axes.

"This is just what I hoping for -- spending the day together as a family
--" Marge begins, but just then the log drops suddenly down a steep
slope and everyone screams.  The log goes through a series of crossbows
and cannons which fire and just miss them, stopping suddenly inches shy
of long metal spikes placed strategically at eye-level.  But the horror
doesn't have time to sink in as the boat falls down another steep slope
straight towards a buzzsaw.  The boat is sliced in half (the family
managing barely to avoid the same fate), and its members are dumped
unceremoniously on a mat next to the river.  Bart and Lisa cheer
happily.

Roger Meyers senior, the gentle genius behind Itchy and Scratchy, loved
and cared about almost all the peoples of the world.  And he, in turn,
was beloved by the world, except in 1938 when he was criticized for his
controversial cartoon, "Nazi Supermen Are Our Superiors".
-- The narrator tells "The Roger Meyers Story", "Itchy and Scratchy
    Land"

<em>"Among his proudest achievements was the full-length musical
`Scratchtasia'," continues the narrator.  A clip shows Scratchy dressed
in a red robe wearing a blue hat with white stars trying to escape being
chopped by Itchy with an ax.  Scratchy manages to wrest the ax from the
mouse's grasp, then, glaring threateningly, he chases the mouse through
a door.  In silhouette we see Scratchy chop the hapless Itchy into
pieces.  Relieved, he walks back into the room, but the individual
pieces of Itchy each turn into a miniature ax-wielding Itchy.  The
troupe threaten Scratchy again, but he chops them all up and pounds them
into a red pulp.  Exhausted, he pulls up a stool, sits down, and
breathes deeply.  The fumes from the Itchy pulp enter his body and turn
into microscopic Itchys that hack away at his insides.  Scratchy grows
old quickly, his skin wrinkling and turning grey, then crumbling from
his body.
</em>
<em>Outside, at another robot parade, a yokel drawls, "Hey Moe, I'm gonna
get me a picture of this crazy critter."  The flash from his camera
makes a Scratchy robot spark.  The ubiquitous guard walks up, laughs

Irishman with it. Pulling him by his beard, he sticks it in an old-
fashioned wringer, and squeeze the poor man.  ("But 'twas all in good
fun!")  "Come on, Itchy! Kill that guy!" Milhouse screams.  Milhouse
reads the next cue card, "A chance for more mischief".  Bart laughs
at the "fat oaf", but Milhouse tells him that it's Teddy Roosevelt.
The cue card reads: "Ah, Manhattan Town. An agreeable sight for an
Old Knickerbocker such as myself."  Never running out of ideas, Itchy
grabs an axe and chops Roosevelt's head off. Covered with blood, he
winks at the camera as the kids laugh themselves out. Follows a bunch

</em><em> The school bus honks its horn, and the kids head out.  Marge holds up two

where it all started to go wrong," he laments.  "How am I supposed to be
a good dad when I never had one myself?"  He kicks the wall, dislodging
an old book from a shelf.  It falls open to reveal a photo of young
Homer greeting Santa Claus on Christmas morning.  He strikes a match and
examines it.  "Oh, Dad wasn't even around on Christmas morning when I
actually got to meet Santa Claus.  Some father...wait a minute!"  He
looks more closely at Santa and realizes it was Abe dressed up.  "Aw,
this photo is a blessing.  It eases my pain."  But the match he's
holding makes the photo catch fire.  He tosses it away, screaming, as
fire spreads around the room.

<em>Meanwhile, in another room of the same house, Abe stands in front of the
fireplace (which has a fire burning in it).  "This tonic's caused me
nothing but trouble," he observes.  "You've done all the damage you're
going to do!" he cries, throwing the bottle on the fire.  It explodes,
spraying rings of fire everywhere.  Abe runs out, yelling.  Homer, too,
runs out of the house, and the two collide on the front porch.

</em><em>
</em><em> ``6 to 8 weeks later''...  The juice loosener arrives, and Homer is

</em><em> befalls the other citizens of Springfield.  Green clouds of germs
</em><em> terrorize all of Springfield, while nevertheless obeying all local
</em><em> traffic laws.
</em><em>
</em><em> Kent Brockman reports that over 300 cases of the dreaded Osaka flu
</em><em> have hit Springfield.  One of them being Arnie Pie in the sky, who

</em><em>
</em><em> Bart's temperature is normal; he's well enough to go to school.
</em><em> Bart asks Marge to take his temperature a second time.  Meanwhile,
</em><em> his antibodies realize that it's a school day and allow the virus to

</em><em>
</em><em> Enjoying his day off from school, Bart watches an Itchy and Scratchy

<em>"Happy, would you like to continue living with us, your loving natural
parents," his father queries, "or would you rather live with this
twisted, loveless billionaire?"  Happy drops his bear and runs into the
limousine, donning sunglasses and proclaiming, "Let's roll!"  But his
father calls out to the speeding limo, "Wait!  You forgot your bear, a

"Happy Birthday, Mr. Smithers..." Smithers groans in pleasure at the
thought.

<em>In the Simpsons' bed, it seems that Homer, too, is calling out for

<em>Burns is unimpressed, however.  Smithers realizes that Burns wants his
bear Bobo back.  Burns calls him a liar, and tries to thrash him, but
he's too feeble.  "Oh God, how I want my bear," he confesses, "but he's
gone, gone forever.  I'd give anything to know what happened to him."

<em>Bobo was covered in snow that first winter when he was dropped by his
first owner, Happy.  During a thaw, he was carried into a river, to be
picked up in 1927 and given to Lindy as he makes a triumphant entrance
to Paris on the "Spirit of St. Louis".  Next, Bobo was with Hitler in
Berlin during the last days of the war in 1945.  Finally, Bobo gets dug
out of the ice in the Arctic and packed in a bag full of ice cubes.
</em>
<em>At the Kwik-E-Mart, one of the ice diggers brings the bags to Apu.
"You've gotta start selling this for more than a dollar a bag," he tells
him, "We lost four men on this expedition!"  Apu challenges him to think
of a better way to get ice, and the man can't come up with one.  So he
and his comrades return to the frozen North.
</em>
<em>Bart buys a bag of ice from the Hindu sales clerk.  He notices a head in
the bag, and Apu quickly thinks up an excuse about the bags with heads
being chock-full of heady goodness.  Bart slaps it down on the counter,
and realizes it's a teddy bear.  "It's probably diseased or something,"
he says, giving it to Maggie.  A close-up of the tags on the bear show
that it is "100% COTTON" and "Bobo".

not your original bear, of course," he concedes, "but it is programmed
to be just as cuddly."  He presses a button on the remote control, and
spiked claws pop out of the oversized bear's paws.  Frink is confused,
thinking he requested the bear to do a little dance.  It grabs Burns,
and Smithers runs up to it, "I got it," and smashes a chair over its
head, to no avail.  Frink tries to shut it off, but it intones in a
robotic monotone, "No, bear want to live," crashing through a wall to
escape.}

then he notices the bear: "Burns' bear!"

Maybe I can still get that drink."  Bart hangs up the phone for Homer,
trying to get Homer to wait and jack up the reward.  Homer sees the

Maggie whimpers as he does so, and Homer pauses.  "Give me the bear,"
Burns demands, "The bear, the bear!" adds Smithers.  But Maggie looks so
sad, and Homer gives in.  "The deal's off, Mr. Burns: the bear stays
here."  Monty tells Homer he's made a mistake and Smithers only growls
as the two leave.

they stand atop Flanders' roof, dressed in black.  Smithers shoots an
arrow into the Simpsons' roof, a wire attached to the arrow.  "Excellent
shot, Smithers, I'll be squeezing my Bobo in no time."  Just then,
Flanders' head pops out the attic: "Howdy, gents, what can I diddily-do

they are rescued by firemen.  "More cocoa, Mr. Burns?" asks Marge,
offering him some cocoa as he sits wrapped in a blanket on the back of
an ambulance.

there and get the bear!"  The crowd cheers and everyone storms the
house.  Moe grabs the bear from Maggie, amid cheering, and the bear is
passed out of the house to safety.  But Maggie looks sad again.  "Aw,
geez, will you look at that," says Moe, and everyone feels bad.  "What

given the word 'mob' a bad name."  So they give the bear back the bear.

% Flashback, accompanied by the song "Don't Worry, Be Happy".  Bart,
% lunchbox in hand, stands at the front door as Marge gets him ready to be
% sent off to school.  Baby Lisa sits on the floor nearby, playing with
% letter blocks.  She stacks them to make the word "STAR". She tries to
% show Marge, but Marge says she's busy getting Bart ready.
% With a frustrated "hmph!" Lisa knocks the blocks over with a smack.  They
% form the word "RATS" on the floor.


Homer: Now son, on your first day of school, I'd like to pass on the words
       of advice my father gave me.
       [Homer remembers his own first day, where Abraham was kneeling down
       to have a talk with him.]
  Abe: Homer, you're dumb as a mule and twice as ugly!  If a strange man
       offers you a ride, I say, take it!
       [Homer re-awakens from his mind wanderings.]
Homer: Lousy traumatic childhood!

-- Reminiscing time, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Outside, a horn beeps.

Marge: Ooh, there's the bus!  Goodbye sweetheart! [she hugs him]
 Bart: [happily] School will be fun!
-- If only, ``Lisa's Sax''

% In the school auditorium, Bart's new Principal gives his opening 
% remarks to the new class of students.

Welcome kindergarteners, I'm Principal Sinner...Skinner!
[The crowd of kids laugh.]
Well, that's it.  I've lost them forever.
-- Class after class of ugly, ugly children, ``Lisa's Sax''

Skinner: Now I'd like to introduce you to Lunch Lady Doris, who'll serve you
         healthy, nutrious meals.
  Doris: Yeah, right.
Skinner: Ms. Phipps, the school nurse, who will provide ointments
         and unguents, and Jimbo, the school bully, who will administer
         noogies and nipple twisters.
  Jimbo: I look forward to wailing on all of you.
-- First impressions, ``Lisa's Sax''

% The kids gulp.  In Bart's class, he and his new schoolmates sit in a
% circle, singing "And Bingo Was His Name-O".  We watch as Bart does a solo.

  Class: [singing] There was a farmer, had a dog, and Bingo was his name-O!
   Bart: B-I-(clap)-(clap)-O!  B-I-(clap)-(clap)-O!  
         B-I-(clap)-(clap)-(clap)!  And Bingo was his name-O!
Teacher: [observing with clipboard] Added extra clap; not college material.
-- Bart's inner child, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Later that day, Bart skips through the grass, humming happily.
% Groundskeeper Willie stops him and yells, through a thick Scottish
% accent, undecipherable exclamations at the boy.  Bart looks at him
% blankly. He points to a sign, which reads "Ach! Keep off the grass!".
% Bart sees the sign and walks melancholically away.  Back at home, Bart
% comes home and walks silently inside the front door.  Marge calls to
% him. Marge cheerfully asks how his day was.
% His lunchbox in one hand and his blanket in the other, Bart walks up
% the stairs without answering.  Back in the present, Homer and Marge
% continue their piano duet.

              Homer: Bart was feeling mighty blue,
              Marge: It's a shame what school can do,

Homer &amp; Marge &amp; Apu: Those were the days!
-- Sing-song, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Bart and Lisa clap on the couch, though Lisa's was really more of a "golf
% clap", as she's about to point out that something got neglected.

Homer: And that my children, is the story of Bart's first day of school.
 Bart: [relaxing back on couch] Very nice.
Homer: Yeah.
 Lisa: Yeah.  Except you were supposed to be telling the story of how I
       got my saxophone!
Homer: [thinks for a second] D'oh!

[End of act one.  Time: 6:58.]

% Act two.  Marge comes into the family room holding Maggie.

Marge: Homer, I can't get the baby to burp.  Could you try it for a while?
Homer: No problem.  I'll just give her a sip of beer!
-- What a great father, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Homer tries to get Maggie to take a drink, which she wants nothing to 
% do with.

 Homer: Come on, Maggie, it's Miller time!  [baby talk] Yes, it's Miller 
        time!
 Marge: Homer!
 Homer: Oh, my father gave me beer as a child.  'Til I wrapped my little
        red wagon around a tree.
        [Flashback to Homer's childhood, where a long line of kids and
        their various vehicles have all rear-ended and smashed into each
        other. Homer and Barney Gumble, as children, are at the front of
        the line, wrecked into a tree.]
Barney: Let's never drink again.
        [Back to reality.  Homer still has the beer in his hand.]
 Homer: And we never did. [takes a swig]
-- ``Lisa's Sax''

 Lisa: Mom, can you tell me a story about how I got my saxophone and not
       have it turn into a story about Bart?!
Marge: Well sure, honey.  Bart had just completed his first day of school,
       and Bart...
 Lisa: Mom!
 Bart: Hey, she's just giving the public what it wants: Bart by the 
       barrelfull!
-- Well.. it WAS 1990, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Marge resumes the story after explaining that it just goes like that.
% Back in 1990, Bart is reciting the alphabet for his kindergarten teacher.

   Bart: A-B-C...uh, line?
Teacher: D!
   Bart: D-E...mmm, line?
Teacher: F, Bart.  And believe me, you'll be seeing plenty of 'em.
-- Early disencouragement, ``Lisa's Sax''

% At home, Bart lies on his bed, depressed. Marge comes in asking if
% Bart would like to read a book, or draw. Bart says he already did.
% He points to the wall, where a picture he drew hangs.  It shows Bart,
% lying on the ground, with knives stuck in him, thunderclouds overhead,
% and the word "SAD" written across the page.  Marge reacts in surprise.  
% Meanwhile, downstairs, Homer has all the lights turned out as he watches
% television.  From the TV, a certain rather strange program bathes the
% room in blue light, casting shadows all about.

TV Voice: That's damn fine coffee you got here in Twin Peaks!  And damn
          good cherry pie!
          [On the screen, a man dances with a horse under a tree, from
          which a stop light hangs.  They dance to the saxophone music being
          played.]
   Homer: Brilliant! [laughs] I have absolutely no idea what's going on.
-- Neither do we, ``Lisa's Sax''

Marge: Homer, I want you to look at this drawing Bart did!
Homer: [faking excitement, watching TV] Oh, it's beautiful!  Oh, oh, let's
       put Bart's beautiful drawing up on the fridge!
Marge: Homer, stop.  Will you please look at the drawing?
Homer: Oh, all right.  What...[looks at drawing]...aaah!!  Burn it!  Send
       it to hell!
Marge: I think we're going to have to get Bart some help.
Homer: [cringing] Get it away!
-- The horrible reality, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Later, Homer comes into Bart's room with a cap, ball, and glove.  Bart
% lies on his bed, motionless.

Homer: Bart, son?  You want to play catch?
 Bart: No.
Homer: When a boy doesn't want to play catch with his old man, something is
       seriously wrong!
  Abe: [wearing old-time baseball uniform] I'll play catch with you, son!
Homer: Get the hell out!
  Abe: I'm gone.
-- Like father, like son, ``Lisa's Sax''

% In Doctor Hibbert's office, Hibbert, who wears an outfit not unlike that
% of Mr. T, gives Bart a check-up.

Mr. Simpson, physically your son is as sound as the dollar!  I'm afraid
Bart's severe emotional dysfunction stems from a deep-seated psychological
trauma. [laughs]
-- I pity da poor boy, ``Lisa's Sax''

% With nowhere else to turn, as Marge narrates to us, the Simpsons go to
% see the school psychologist.

Dr. Pryor: Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, there's nothing to be alarmed about.  
           Public school can be intimidating to a young child,
           particularly one with as many flamboyantly homosexual
           tendencies as your son.
    Marge: Bart's gay?
Dr. Pryor: Bart?  Ah, whoo, wrong file.
           [Dr. Pryor puts a file reading "VANHOUTEN, MILHOUSE" back onto
           the rack.]
-- He thinks I'm gay? (everybody dance now!) ``Lisa's Sax''


Ah, the point I'm trying to make here is, that Bart must learn to be less
of an individual, and more a...faceless slug.
-- Top notch advice. Dr. Pryor, ``Lisa's Sax''

% With this, he looks down to see Lisa, on Marge's lap, who is busy 
% piecing together a jigsaw puzzle, depicting the Taj Mahal, on Dr. Pryor's 
% desk.

Dr. Pryor: Hm, Lisa, how old are you?
     Lisa: I am three and three eighths!
Dr. Pryor: Hm!  Lisa, if I have five apples, and I take away three apples,
           how many apples do I have left?
     Lisa: Two apples!
    Homer: Wait a minute! [counts on fingers] She's right!
-- Great Scott! ``Lisa's Sax''

Dr. Pryor: Heh, very good.  Marge, Homer, I believe your Lisa may be gifted.
    Marge: That's wonderful!  But still, can't you do anything for Bart?
    Homer: Marge, he's five, his life is over.  Lisa's the wave of
           the future!
     Lisa: Wave of the future!
Dr. Pryor: Uh huh, that's right, honey.  If you nurture her gift now, 
           there's no telling what she can do.
    Homer: Wow...just think of the possibilities!
           [In dreamland, Homer imagines Lisa winning the Nobel Prize.
    Homer: Nah!
           [In revised dreamland, Homer imagines Lisa, wearing a black
           belt, winning the Nobel Prize...for kickboxing!  With the medal
           around her neck, she kicks the official who has just presented
           it to her.]
    Homer: Hmm!
-- Disfunctionally raised, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Dr. Pryor promises them the address of a good preschool.
% At a nearby highly prestigeous-looking preschool, we see kids using 
% computers, painting, and playing a clapping game while reciting the
% digits of pi.  Marge and Homer talk with the headmaster, while Lisa sits
% nearby, crafting a horse out of clay.

Headmaster: I can assure you our preschool is of the highest quality.  Over
            seventy-five percent of our graduates go on to first grade!
     Homer: Well, our little girl has a gift, and we're willing to do what
            it takes to help her.
Headmaster: Very good.  Once we receive your six thousand dollar tuition 
            check, she's in.
     Homer: I'll give you fifty bucks.
Headmaster: Our fee is non-negotiable.
     Homer: Seventy-five!
     Marge: Look, I knew private school would be expensive, but I was hoping
            we could get a scholarship of some sort.
Headmaster: Sorry.  I don't have anything to offer you unless you're a
            member of a minority group.
     Homer: [Mexican accent] Excellente!  Muchos gracias seniorata!
Headmaster: Sorry.
     Homer: [Chinese accent] Aah-so...
-- The man of many faces, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Marge and Homer leave the preschool, taking Lisa with them.
% ``Come on, honey, I guess this is a world you'll never know.''
% Sad music accompanies our journey back into the present, where Homer
% continues to narrate the story.

Homer: Our family was suffering through its worst crisis ever.  Bart was
       miserable at school, and Lisa's gifts were going to waste.
 Bart: Uh, Homer?  It's five years later, and I'm still miserable at 
       school.
 Lisa: And my gifts are still going to waste!
Marge: And sometimes I feel so smothered by this family I just want to 
       scream until my lungs explode!!
       [The rest of the family stares at Marge for a moment.  She regains
       her composure after a deep breath.]
Marge: I'll go start dinner now. [leaves for kitchen]
Homer: You do that.
-- Getting some jitters out of the system, ``Lisa's Sax''

[End of act two.  Time: 12:19.]

% Act three.  Grandpa Simpson has come over for a visit.

Homer: Dad, what are you doing here?
  Abe: Looking for my teeth!
       [Santa's Little Helper has the false teeth in place in his mouth.]
  Abe: Gimmie those! [takes teeth] Better wash these off.  Aw, the hell with
       it. [puts teeth in mouth, dog drool and all]
-- Ewwww, ``Lisa's Sax''

Marge: Well, Grandpa, as long as you're here, we were telling a story that
       took place when Bart was five, and Lisa was three.
  Abe: Oh, I know this story!  The year was nineteen-ought-six.  The 
       President is the divine Miss Sarah Burnheart.  And all over America,
       people were doin' a dance called the "Funky Grandpa"!  [sings] Oh...
       I'm...the...[falls asleep standing up]
Marge: Ye-es...well, as if our troubles weren't bad enough, Springfield 
       was going through an unseasonable heat wave.
-- ``Lisa's Sax''

% Back in 1990, Homer sweats up the couch in his underwear, watching a
% Kent Brockman report on TV.

Brockman: And so Springfield's heat wave continues, with today's temperature
          exceeding the record for this date, set way back four billion 
          years ago, when the earth was just a ball of molten lava!
   Homer: Oh...so hot...
   Marge: Homer, have you seen the frozen peas?
          [Homer, after wiping his face with a frozen dinner, pulls the
          peas out from underneath him.]
   Marge: Ahh, you keep 'em.
-- The heatwave, ``Lisa's Sax''

Marge: Now listen, if we can't afford private school, maybe there's some
       other way to encourage Lisa.  Eh, an art class! Ballet lessons!
       They have some fun things you can do at the museum on Saturday!
Homer: Uh-uh.  Forget it, Marge.  There is no way I am spending my
       Saturdays at a museum.  Unless...museums don't have foosball, do
       they?
       [Homer imagines himself at the museum, playing foosball with a
       statue.]
Homer: You lose, Michealangelo's "David"!  Who's next?
       [The subject of Edvard Munch's "The Cry" comes out to play with a
       shriek of "Meeeeeee!".]

Marge: Mmm, it doesn't matter.  All these things cost money and we don't 
       have it.  Unless...
Homer: Unless...what?
Marge: Well, there is that two hundred dollars we've been saving for the
       new air conditioner.
Homer: Oh, Marge, but...we've needed a new air conditioner for years!  And
       our stop-gap solution is getting cranky!
       [That cranky "stop-gap solution" happens to be a white cat with a
       fan on its tail, blowing air onto a block of ice.  It lets out an
       angry meow.]

Marge: I cannot believe this!  I'm trying to give our daughter a head start
       in life, and you aren't not helping a bit!
Homer: Marge, name one successful person in life who ever lived without air
       conditioning.
Marge: Balzac!
Homer: No need for potty mouth just because you can't think of one.
Marge: But Balzac is the name!
Homer: [interrupting] "If if's and but's were candy and nuts..." eh, 
       how does the rest of that go?
-- Just shut up, ``Lisa's Sax''


% Homer decides there must be another way of getting air conditioning

% Later, Homer is sitting pretty on his couch in the cool air of an A/C.  
% "Mmm...recirculated air," he remarks as the white cat walks by, nearly

  Ned: Uh, Homer?
Homer: What, Flanders?
  Ned: [politely] Well sir, I hate to be suspicious-allouicious on you,

       [We take a look out the window, and see an obvious path leading from
       a hole torn out of the side of Ned's house in the window where his
       air conditioner used to be, leading to a knocked over fence
       accompanied by footprints in the soil, and a newly installed unit
       sticking out of Homer's window.]
Homer: Well, I admit it looks bad, Flanders, but haven't you heard of "let
       he who is without sin cast the first stone"?
       [Homer gets hit in the head with a rock.
 Todd: Got him, dad!

Marge: Grandpa, what are you talking about?
  Abe: Ohh...nothing.
-- Hey old dude, gimmie two reds and a yellow, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Marge resumes the storytelling.
% At kindergarten, Bart sits in a circle of kids for storytime.  His
% lackluster teacher reads "The Ugly Duckling".

   Bart: Even me?
Teacher: No.
-- ``Lisa's Sax''

% At the school playground, Bart sits alone on a bench at lunchtime,

Milhouse: Uh, hi.
    Bart: Hi.
Milhouse: I have soy milk.  The doctor says the real kind could kill me.
    Bart: I wish I was interesting like you.
-- We learned so very much about Milhouse today, ``Lisa's Sax''

% Milhouse starts drinking.  Bart sees him, and makes a farting noise by
% blowing on his hands.  Milhouse laughs so hard he spits up milk.
% Milhouse tells Bart he's funny, and the world needs a clown.
% Later, Bart gives his first comedic performance, standing on a bench,

 Bart: [fart noise]  Doodie!  [fart noise]  Booger!
       [Bart's captive audience laughs.]
Jimbo: That is killer material!
 Bart: [singing] Skinner is a nut!  He has a rubber butt!

         [Bart looks at Skinner, then Jimbo.  It's his moment of truth.]

% Homer takes Lisa out of Moe's, and arrives at "It Blows", the air
% conditioning store.  He takes a look at a model of A/C, and takes joy in

% air it would provide, while Patty and Selma melt in the summer heat outside.
% Looking across the street, however, he sees Lisa gazing in the window of

</em><em> In his bedroom, Homer wields an axe.  ``They are all against me...  They

rolls straight into the gutter.  "Well, next time, a few steps more
toward center, don't you think?" he asks jovially.  "Goodbye, trophy,"

</em>
<em>Burns' second shot teeters on the edge of the gutter.  Otto, at the game

I got a hold of, it's _big_!"  The ball rolls on the edge and glances
off two pins, making them wobble.  Otto, with a final grunt, dislodges
the screw, pulling the leg of the machine and toppling it.  The
vibration causes the two pins to fall.  "Yes!" cheer Burns' teammates.
"Excellent," says Burns.  Otto looks down at the prizes, grabs the

       must discard my teammates, much like the boxer must shed roll
       after roll of sweaty, useless, disgusting flab before he can win

<em>Homer's three former teammates stand outside the gates of Burns'
compound and cheer Homer on.  "Go, Homer!  You're our man.  If you can't
do it, no one can!"  Homer smashes a window at Burns' place and grabs
the trophy, setting off the alarm and releasing the hounds.  He makes a
dash for the gate, but doesn't make it over in time.  The dogs tear him
to shreds as Otto remarks, "Well, I guess no one can."  Moe cries, "Run
before they're through feeding!"  They do so as Homer continues to be

<em>First segment title: "The Thing and I"
</em>
<em>The night has fallen upon Springfield, and everything is quiet.
However, Bart and Lisa are awakened by strange moaning and rattling
sounds.
</em>
<b>Lisa:</b> Did you hear that, Bart?
<b>Bart:</b> Maybe it was just the cat.
<b>Lisa:</b> No, she's sleeping with me.
       [<i>Snowball II shows up, wearing a baby bonnet and booties</i>]
-- Like child like cat, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>It appears the sounds originate from the attic. The next morning,
during breakfast, Bart asks Homer about it.
</em>
 <b>Bart:</b> Did you guys hear something moving around in the attic last
       night?
<b>Homer:</b> Attic? Oh, that's silly.  [<i>laughs</i>]  Seriously though, don't ever
       go up there.
-- What a frank attitude, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<b>Marge:</b> Homer, isn't it about time for the... you know?
<b>Homer:</b> Yeah, yeah, I'll go feed it.
       [<i>goes to the fridge, where he picks up a bucket of fish heads</i>]
       [<i>singing</i>] Fish heads, fish heads, doo doo doo doo doo...
-- Nothing suspicious there, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>Homer whistles all the way to the attic, followed by Bart and Lisa.
They can't see what's going on in there, but the sound of animal
munching they hear is nothing to reassure them.
</em>
<em>The following night, Bart not only hears, but also sees something
crawling in the air ducts. Come morning, the kids ask to be told the
truth.
</em>
 <b>Lisa:</b> What's up there?
 <b>Bart:</b> Is it a monster?
 <b>Lisa:</b> We have to know.
 <b>Bart:</b> Tell us what's the secret.
<b>Homer:</b> No more questions. I work my butt off to feed you four kids and
       all you do is...  [<i>Marge is staring at him</i>]  What?
<b>Marge:</b> <em>Three</em>. We have <em>three</em> kids, Homer.
<b>Homer:</b> Yeah, three <em>nosy</em> kids. And you know what happens to nosy kids
       who ask too many questions?
 <b>Kids:</b> [<i>quickly</i>]  No, what? Does something happen? Does something happen
       to nosy kids who ask questions? What happens?
-- Never mind, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>Since they cannot get any explanation from their parents, Bart and
Lisa decide to investigate the matter. After Homer and Marge go out
for a moment, they form a human ladder with Maggie, who opens the
attic's door.
</em>
<em>Slowly and carefully, they step into the attic, where dozens of
useless items are stacked up, collecting dust. Among them, Bart
discovers the unsold copies of Homer's autobiography, "Homer, I Hardly
Knew Me". Lisa quickly directs his attention to a pair of restricting
chains, from which something has just escaped. The creature emerges in
the shadows and jumps right before the kids, causing them to run in
fear.
</em>
       [<i>view of 3 vases, matching the kids' height</i>]
<b>Lisa:</b> [<i>muffled</i>]  Bart, do you think it's safe?
<b>Bart:</b> [<i>muffled</i>]  I don't care -- I can't breathe in here!
       [<i>the kids rush out of a nearby closet, gasping for air</i>]
-- They still remember Tracey Ullman, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>At that moment, Homer and Marge come back into the house.
</em>
See, Marge, who needs a car-wash when you can just drive around in the
rain?
-- Homer, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<b>Bart+Lisa:</b> [<i>quickly</i>]  Mom! Dad! We saw something in the attic! We saw
           something in the attic!
    <b>Marge:</b> You went into the attic?  [<i>gasps</i>]  I'm very disappointed and
           terrified.
-- Thanks for calming my fears, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>Armed with an iron club, Homer pokes his head into the attic, and
witnesses that "it" has escaped, leaving behind his chains and a dish
full of bones. The whole family gasps in horror when they hear rapid
footsteps and see the front door wide open.
</em>
<em>Marge doesn't waste any time and picks up the phone.
</em>
<b>Marge:</b> Yes, doctor. It's what we've always feared: it's loose. Hugo is
       loose. See you soon!
-- Casual phonecalls, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>Of course, Bart and Lisa overheard.
</em>
 <b>Bart:</b> Who or what is Hugo?
<b>Marge:</b> Hmm. I'm afraid we haven't been entirely honest with you, Bart.
       You see... you have a brother.
 <b>Lisa:</b> So I have <em>two</em> brothers?
<b>Homer:</b> Lisa, please.  [<i>pushes her aside</i>]
-- "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>Homer explains that Bart has in fact a twin brother: "When you were
born, there was an irregularity."  "A monstrous irregularity" adds Dr.
Hibbert, coming out of nowhere, much to Marge stupor.
</em>
<b>Hibbert:</b> Yes, I remember Bart's birth well. You don't forget a thing
         like... [<i>dramatic</i>] Siamese twins!
   <b>Lisa:</b> I believe they prefer to be called "conjoined twins".
<b>Hibbert:</b> And Hillbillies prefer to be called "sons of the soil". But it
         ain't gonna happen.
-- "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>Dr. Hibbert narrates the birth of Bart and Hugo. It seems that one of
them was pure evil.
</em>
        [<i>Hibbert shows Bart-Hugo to Marge</i>]
        [<i>one of them starts gnawing the other ferociously</i>]
<b>Marge:</b> I think I'll bottle-feed that one.
-- "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<b>Hibbert:</b> The routine soul smear confirmed the presence of pure evil. It
         was then I knew the only option was to separate you two
         immediately.  [<i>chops a paper cutter</i>]
         [<i>hands forms to Marge and Homer</i>]  You'll both need to sign
         these.  [<i>chuckles</i>]
-- "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<b>Hibbert:</b> But what to do with poor Hugo? Too crazy for Boys Town, too
         much of a boy for Crazy Town. The child was an outcast. So, we
         did the only humane thing.
  <b>Homer:</b> We chained Hugo up in the attic like an animal and fed him a
         bucket of fish heads once a week.
  <b>Marge:</b> It's saved our marriage.
-- "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>But Bart remains sceptic: "You expect me to believe all this? If any
of it was true, wouldn't I have a big hideous scar right --". Indeed,
the scar is there.
</em>
<em>The family starts looking for Hugo.
</em>
<b>Homer:</b> We'll search out every place a sick twisted solitary misfit might
       run to.
 <b>Lisa:</b> I'll start with Radio Shack.
-- Hey, I used to hang out there!, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

Bart, you stay home and tape the hockey game.
-- Homer, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>Bart locks every door and window, until he hears rustling from inside
the house. "You're here, aren't you?" he realizes. His twin brother
comes out of the shadows, holding a glass and a plate of fish heads:
"Yes, Bart, I never left you." Bart inquires about what Hugo might
want from him. "You'll see, Hugo replies, after the surgery."
</em>
<em>So here is Bart, tied up in the attic.
</em>
<b>Hugo:</b> I went mad after they tore us apart, but I'll be sane... once I
      sew us back together.
<b>Bart:</b> But you'll <em>kill</em> both of us.
<b>Hugo:</b> No, it's easy. Look, I've been practicing: I made a pigeon-rat.
       [<i>said pigeon-rat flies into a wall, falls back, and tries to</i>
<i>       enter a mouse hole</i>]
-- Natural evolution, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

Well, let's get started: you want to be on the right or the left?
-- Hugo, about to sew himself to Bart, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>Fortunately for Bart, Dr. Hibbert shows up right on time.
</em>
<b>Hibbert:</b> There, there, Hugo. I understand. All those years caged up in
         here, why, you've probably never ever seen your own face in the
         mirror, have you? Here.
          [<i>Hibbert hands up a frame between him and Hugo</i>]
   <b>Hugo:</b> Mmm?  [<i>stares into the frame, which reveals Hibbert's face</i>]
          [<i>Hibbert punches him through the (empty) frame</i>]
-- No need for violence, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>Homer and Marge step in.
</em>
We think we saw Hugo at the airport; he was boarding a plane to
Switzerland and...  [<i>sees Hugo</i>]  Oh.
-- Homer, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>Marge unties Bart while Hibbert and Homer take care of Hugo.
</em>
<b>Hibbert:</b> You know, isn't it interesting how the left -- or sinister --
         twin is invariably the evil one. I had this theory that... Wait
         a minute. Hugo's scar is on the wrong side. He couldn't have
         been the evil left twin. That means the evil twin is, and
         always has been... Bart!
   <b>Bart:</b> Oh, don't look so shocked.
<b>Hibbert:</b> Well, chalk this one up to carelessness on my part.
-- Pobody's Nerfect, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>Nevertheless, Hibbert thinks "there's a way to set everything right".
</em>
<em>Later that day, everybody -- with Hugo in lieu of Bart -- is gathered
around the table for a nice family dinner.
</em>
<b>Hibbert:</b> Care for a drumstick, Hugo?
          [<i>Hugo noisily eats his drumstick in 3 seconds, wipes his</i>
<i>          mouth, then starts eating the napkin</i>]
   <b>Lisa:</b> Mom, Hugo's eating his napkin.
          [<i>laughter</i>]
   <b>Bart:</b> [<i>from the air ducts</i>]  Hey, can I have some turkey?
  Marge: No, you finish your fish heads. Then we'll talk.  [<i>closes the</i>
<i>         vent</i>]

</em>
<em>Segment two title: "The Genesis Tub"
</em>
<em>In front of her mirror, Lisa looks at the newest gap in her dentition.
</em>
<b>Lisa:</b> This tooth will be perfect for my science project.
       [<i>sets up her exhibit: "Will cola dissolve a tooth?"</i>]
      Science has already proven the dangers of smoking, alcohol and
      chinese food, but I can still ruin soft drinks for everyone!
-- A lifetime mission, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

Bart: Hey, Lis. Check out <em>my</em> science project.  [<i>rubs a balloon over</i>
<i>      his head, then touches Lisa with a spark of static electricity</i>]
<b>Lisa:</b> Ow! What's <em>that's</em> supposed to prove?
<b>Bart:</b> That nerds conduct electricity.  [<i>touches her again</i>]
<b>Lisa:</b> Ow!
-- "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>Bart runs away laughing, and Lisa gets back to her exhibit. When she
touches her tooth, now soaking in cola, she gets a shock again.
"Stupid Bart" she grumbles, not making much a case of it.
</em>
<em>Throughout the night, Lisa sleeps deeply, while the tooth and the cola
seem to undergo some sort of strange electrical reaction. Come
morning, Lisa wakes up and looks at her experiment.
</em>
Oh boy, mold! That's science fair pay dirt.
-- I can't hold my excitement, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>She brings the tub under her microscope for further analysis. "Looks
about the same" she complains, until she notices the microscope is set
for 1x magnification. She brings it to 10x, then 100x, to find
something shocking: miniature prehistoric human lifeform.
</em>
 <b>Lisa:</b> [<i>gasps</i>]  Tiny little people! My God! I've created life!
<b>Marge:</b> Lisa! Breakfast! We're having waffles!
 <b>Lisa:</b> Ooh! Waffles!  [<i>runs down</i>]
-- The meal of choice of Darwin, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>She gets disappointed once she reaches her seat, as the promised
waffles are "just square pancakes", the waffle iron being in the shop.
"The waffle iron's been in the shop forever" she grumbles back to her
room.
</em>
<em>Taking another look at her microscope, she is stunned to observe that
her "little stone age tub dwellers" have already evolved into the
Renaissance.
</em>
Wait, one of them is nailing something to the door of the cathedral.
[<i>gasps</i>]  I've created Lutherans!
-- Lisa, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>During the night, light emerges from the tub, lighting up the whole
room. The following day, the tub has already evolved well beyond our
own world. Lisa marvels to this sight of our own possible future.
</em>
<em>Bart steps in and inquires about her project; when he sees what seems
like a model city, he squashes some bits of it ("Oops, my finger
slipped"), and runs away laughing. Looking back at her microscope,
Lisa witnesses the damage he's caused.
</em>
<em>The following night, a squadron of spaceships launch from the tub and
proceed to attack Bart for a short time before they come back to their
base. Bearing many bumps on the face, the boy bursts into Lisa's room,
ready to strike back. Lisa stops him in time.
</em>
<b>Bart:</b> Your micro-jerks attacked me!
<b>Lisa:</b> Well, you practically destroyed their whole world.
<b>Bart:</b> You can't protect them every second. Sooner or later, you'll let
      your guard down, and then flush: it's toilet time for Tinytown.
-- "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>Bart leaves, and Lisa sits next to the tub, expressing a long sigh.
Her attention is suddenly caught by a whirring sound from the tub,
followed by some sort of energy which surrounds her, shrinking her and
bringing her into the tub. She is dropped on a tooth-shaped seat, in
front of an audience which seems to comprise every man and woman in
this world.
</em>
<em>A Frink-like man rejoices.
</em>
It worked! The de-bigulator world!
-- Tiny Frink, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>The audience hails her, and what seems to be a spiritual leader greets
her.
</em>
<b>Leader:</b> Welcome to our world, most gracious Lisa.
  <b>Lisa:</b> Your world is incredible. <em>And</em> you speak English.
<b>Leader:</b> We have listened to you speak since the dawn of time, O Creator.
        And we have learned to imatoot you exarktly.
-- Close enough, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>The audience bows, revealing a statue of Lisa. She then realizes that
she is granted the status of godhood, as she is the one who created
this world. In that aspect, those people are counting on her to save
them from the devil, ie. Bart.
</em>
<em>When she announces that the devil is her brother, murmurs emerge from
the audience. Gradually, people come forward with the usual boring
theological questions (why does a good god allow bad things).
</em>
 <b>Lisa:</b> Listen, I can take care of everything. All you have to do is
       unshrink me.
<b>Frink:</b> Unshrink you? Well, that would require some sort of a
       <em>re</em>-bigulator, which is a concept so ridiculous is makes me want
       to laugh out loud and chortle, and...  [<i>Lisa looks at him</i>]  uh...
       but not at you, O holiest of gods, with the wrathfulness and the
       vengeance and the blood rain and the hey-hey-hey-it-hurts-me...
-- "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>His words are quickly covered by screams from the audience, as the
grinning face of Bart appears in the sky. He closes the tub, which is
later opened by... Principal Skinner.
</em>
First-rate work, Bart. This universe you've created is even more
impressive than Martin's milk-carton ukulele.
-- Principal Skinner, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>Skinner nominates Bart as winner, and instructs Willy to throw out the
other projects. Children moan.

       probing can teach us.
-- And what a passionating subject, "Treehouse of Horror VII"

<em>Kodos explains that they're on a mission of conquest, and need to
locate Earth's leader.
</em>
<b>Homer:</b> I guess you mean President Clinton. He usually hangs around
       Washington, D.C.
 <b>Kang:</b> President Clin-Ton? Excellent.
<b>Homer:</b> Except, um... there's this election next week, so after that, it
       might not be him anymore. It might be what's-his-name, uh...

<em>This election complicates matters a bit, so Kang and Kodos decide to

</em><em> Next up is SLH, which he diagnoses with a twisted stomach.  The life-saving

</em><em> talk about?''  In the waiting room is Krusty with a cigar-smoking chimp.
</em><em> ``Mister Teeny needs a refill of his nicotine gum.''
</em><em>
</em><em> On the ride home, Bart asks when SLH is going to have his operation, but

   Homer: Oh, uh... Hitler's dog... and that dog Nixon had, what's his name,
          um, Chester...
   Lisa:  [annoyed] Checkers.

   Bart:  You're gonna just let him [SLH] die?
   Marge: I know you're upset...
   Bart:  Darn right, I'm upset!
   Marge: Bart, watch your language! ... Oh, you did.  Sorry.

-- Barney's short-term memory, "A Star is Burns"

<em>Barney's movie is in black and white.  It opens with a shot of a Duff
beer bottle on a windowsill.  Gauzy white curtains billow around it as
the love theme from "M.  Butterfly" plays.  A hand grabs the bottle and
turns it upside down; the camera pans slowly down to reveal Barney's
lips on the other end of it.
</em>
<em>The next shot shows Barney from above lying on a couch under the window.
As a voiceover, he says, "My name is Barney Gumbel.  I'm 40, I'm single,
and I drink."  The scene fades to a road where Barney lies in the
gutter, drinking another Duff, then lying down.  The Duff pours slowly
into a sewer grating.  "There's a line in `Othello' about a drinker:
`Now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast.'  That
pretty well covers it."  The camera shows a time lapse view of clouds
moving during the day, which turns to night, then back to day again.
Barney has become an old man, bald, toothless, still lying in the same
gutter.  A tear leaks from his eye.
</em>
<em>A woman watching the movie is moved.

 <b>Woman: </b>It's brilliant: savagely honest, tender...he has the soul of a

-- Methinks the man doth protest too much, "A Star is Burns"

<em>Back on the screen, Barney sits in a chair and says, "My name is Barney
Gumbel, and I'm an alcoholic."  The camera pulls back to reveal several
similarly-attired girls.  Lisa says, "Mr. Gumbel, this is a Girl Scout
meeting."  Barney asks, "Is it?  Or is it that you girls can't admit you
have a problem?"
</em>
<em>The scene fades to a playing record player, then back to Barney on the
couch, a rose held to his nose.  "Don't cry for me," he narrates, "I'm
already dead."  He puts the rose in the Duff bottle on the windowsill;
its petals fall off slowly, and the curtain billows in front of it as
"Fin" appears.
</em>
<em>Everyone applauds wildly; Marge blows her nose.  "I think we have a
winner," says Jay.  Homer walks in holding a beer and asks, "What'd I
miss?"  Marge chides him, "Homer, please pay attention!  There's just
one more movie."  That movie is "A Burns for All Seasons", starring
Montgomery Burns as Montgomery Burns, Bumblebee Man, and Tommy Tune as
"Smithers".  The title sequence features the picture from the Sistene
Chapel of God touching Adam's finger, except instead of Adam, it's
Burns.  A long list of writers scrolls by, ending with Lowell Burns and
Babaloo Smithers.
</em>
<em>The first scene opens with Mr. Burns atop a horse wearing a sombrero,
rounds of machine gun ammunition draped across his chest.  "Simple
villagers," he says to a group of people, "I promise you I will close
plants in America and bring work here!"  Chespirito cries, "Viva Senor
Burns!" and the assembled villagers cry, "Viva!  Viva!"  Burns' horse
gallops off, but Burns doesn't manage to stay in the saddle, instead
getting dragged back and forth along the ground.  In the audience, Burns
laments, "We did twenty takes, and _that_ was the best one."
</em>
<em>The next scene features Mr. Burns saying, "Remember, Elliot, I'll be
right here," on one knee to a child.  The tip of his finger lights up
briefly; he then enters a spaceship, its door spiraling closed, which
takes off into the crimson sky.  The audience murmurs angrily among
themselves, "Pure egotism!  Self-indulgent tripe," and the like.  "I
don't care what they say," vows Burns, "I'm going to win this festival!"
</em>
<em>The next scene shows a Roman centurion on a horse leading a group of
shackled prisoners across the desert.  The last prisoner, who bears a
striking resemblance to Charlton Heston, collapses from exhaustion.  A
shadow appears over him: a man kneels in front of him, strokes his hair,
and hands him a bottle of spring water.  "Drink up, Judah Ben Hur,"
exhorts Mr. Burns.  Ben Hur does so, then looks up gratefully and says,
"You truly are the king of kings."  A heavenly light shines down upon
Burns, and he says "Excellent."  The movie ends.
</em>
<b>Audience: </b>Boo!  Boo!
   <b>Burns: </b>Smithers...are they booing me?
<b>Smithers: </b>Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns!  Boo-urns!"

airplane" but taking a long time to put the spoon in baby's mouth.  As a

her to a cornfield once, when a biplane swoops down and fires its

   Look, fellas.  It's Lisa in the sky.
   -- Ringo, ``Last Exit to Springfield''
   
<em> When Lisa wakes up, she immediately asks for the mirror.  Dr. Wolfe
</em><em> backs away in fear.  Lisa takes the mirror, giggles, then breaks out
</em><em> into a cackle.  Her grotesque shadow is cast on the wall.  Lisa
</em><em> smashes the mirror.
</em><em>
</em><em> Lisa comes home with her new braces.  Santa's Little Helper comes
</em><em> bounding into the room, but is scared away when Lisa flashes her
</em><em> metallic smile.
</em>   
   Homer: [answering the door]  Who is it?
   Voice: Goons.
   Homer: Who?
   Voice: Hired goons.
   Homer: Hired goons?  [opens the door]
   Goons: [take Homer roughly away]
   -- ``Last Exit to Springfield''
   
<em> The goons take Homer to Stately Burns Mansion, where Monty waits for
</em><em> them in the aviary.  (The vulture perched nearby bears a striking
</em><em> resemblance.)  Monty shows Homer the world's largest television set
</em><em> (now showing:  The bumblebee guy).  A room with a thousand monkeys
</em><em> at a thousand typewriters.  (``It was the best of times, it was
</em><em> blurst of times.'')
</em>   
   Burns: And this is my basement.
          [reveals a traditional unfinished basement,
          complete with ping-pong table]
   Homer: Gee, it's not as nice as the other rooms.
   Burns: Yes, I really should stop ending the tour with it.
   -- ``Last Exit to Springfield''
   
   Burns: Now, let's get down to business.
   Homer: [thinks] Oh, man.  I have to go to the bathroom.
          Why did I have all that beer and coffee and watermelon?
          [water drips in the background, Smithers pours a cup of coffee]
   Burns: Now Homer, I know what you're thinking.
          I want to take the pressure off.
          Now, it doesn't take a `whiz' to know that
          you're looking out for `Number One'.
          Well, listen to me, and you'll make a big splash very soon.
   -- ``Last Exit to Springfield''
   
   Homer: Which way to the bathroom?
   Burns: Oh, it's the twenty-third door on the left.
   -- ``Last Exit to Springfield''
   
<em> Homer reaches a looooong corridor, opening door after door, not
</em><em> finding a bathroom.  Homer eventually returns.  ``Find the bathroom
</em><em> all right?''  Homer stops.  ``Uhh....  Yeahhhhhhh.''
</em><em>
</em><em> Monty Burns literally drops Homer off in his private helicopter.
</em><em> Marge rushes out to greet him, but her hair is chopped off by the
</em><em> helicopter blades.  (I was waiting for that to happen.)  Monty's
</em><em> dramatic and threatening exit comes to a rapid halt when he falls
</em><em> out of the helicopter.  After being bandaged and placed in a
</em><em> stretcher slung from the helicopter, he resumes his diabolical
</em><em> laughter.  (His stretcher bounces into a nearby chimney as the
</em><em> copter leaves.)
</em><em>
</em><em> Homer wonders why he was elected union president, then realizes that
</em><em> all the coworkers have been making fun of him.  So he punches Lenny
</em><em> in the back of the head first thing in the morning.
</em><em>
</em><em> It's picture day at Springfield Elementary.  Lisa sits with an
</em><em> adorable bow in her ahir, but her mouth is glued shut.  The
</em><em> photographer cajoles her into smiling, but when she reveals her
</em><em> braces, he is taken aback.  ``There is no God!''  Lisa's face falls,
</em><em> and the picture is taken.
</em><em>
</em><em> Homer tells the union brothers that he's fed up, and they call for a
</em><em> strike.  Carl again runs the vote.  ``All in favor of a strike?''
</em><em> ``Aye!''  ``All opposed?''  Again, a solitary meek voice votes,
</em><em> ``Nay.''  At the back of the room are two men.  One meek and frail,
</em><em> the other solid and robust.  The meek one points at the stronger
</em><em> one.  ``It was him.  Let's get him, fellas'' The entire union
</em><em> membership beat up the strong guy.  The meek guy chuckles.
</em><em>
</em><em> [End of Act Two.  Time: 14:54]
</em><em>
</em><em> Lisa accompanies the striking employees with a song on her guitar.
</em><em> (What a talented girl.  Shame about the teeth.)  Burns tells
</em><em> Smithers to get some strikebreakers, ``The ones they had in the
</em><em> '30's.''  Grampa and his pals are called in.  ``We can't bust heads
</em><em> like we used to, but we have our ways.  One trick is to tell 'em
</em><em> stories that don't go anywhere.''  Grampa launches into a story that
</em><em> goes nowhere.  Onions on the belt were all the style.
</em><em>
</em><em> Burns is ready to hose down the rowdy strikers.  But when Smithers
</em><em> turns on the hose, the water pressure throws Burns about like a
</em><em> wayward rocket.
</em><em>
</em><em> Lisa concludes her song.  Lenny makes a request for ``Classical Gas'',
</em><em> which Lisa fills,
</em><em> further demonstrating her skill as a guitarist.
</em><em>
</em><em> Burns is convinced that he and Smithers can run the plant
</em><em> themselves.  And they do, in a phenomenally silly manner.  But
</em><em> things run awry when the robot workers turn against their employers.
</em>   
   Tonight, on Smartline.  ``The Power plant strike.  Argle bargle, or fooforaw?''

   Homer: Woo-hoo!
   -- ``Last Exit to Springfield''
   
<em> Burns is permitted his requested opening tirade.  Burns threatens
</em><em> dire events in fifteen minutes.
</em><em>
</em><em> Burns and Smithers march down the corridors of power, past numerous
</em><em> security measures, eventually leading to a hidden control room.
</em><em> ``Oh, for God's sake!''  Burns realizes that they left the (dilapidated)
</em><em> back door
</em><em> open.  With a ``From hell's heart, I stab at thee!'' Burns pushes
</em><em> the button.  Power goes out all around town.  Normal, law-abiding
</em><em> citizens instantly turn to looting.  A moving electric billboard
</em><em> reads, ``Total blackout in Springfield.''  The strikers are not
</em><em> deterred.  Lisa leads them in song.
</em><em>
</em><em> On his balcony, Burns cups his ear.  What?  They're spirit is not
</em><em> broken?
</em>   
   Look at them all, through the darkness I'm bringing.
   They're not sad at all.  They're actually singing!
   They sing without juicers.
   They sing without blenders.
   They sing without flunjers, capdabblers and smendlers!
   -- ``Last Exit to Springfield''
   
<em> Burns calls Homer to the negotiating table.  He gives in on the
</em><em> dental plan, on one condition:  That Homer resign as union
</em><em> president.  Homer celebrates, doing a Three Stooges.  Burns watches,
</em><em> perplexed.  ``Smithers, I'm beginning to think that Homer Simpsons
</em><em> is not the brilliant tactician I thought he was.''
</em><em>
</em><em> Power returns to Springfield.  Including the peep show district.
</em><em> And the fake vomit factory.
</em><em>
</em><em> Sitting in the dentist's chair, Lisa smiles a toothy grin.  The
</em><em> family are gathered around.  Marge is pleased.  ``You can hardly see
</em><em> the braces.''  Lisa responds, ``And that's the tooth!''  All laugh
</em><em> uproariously.  The dentist notices, ``Whoops.  I left the [laughing]

the Dean up in a carpet and throwing him off a bridge?  Bart has a
better idea: pignapping the Springfield A&amp;M mascot, Sir Oinkcelot.
Homer combines the plans, suggesting they roll the pig up in a carpet
and throw him off a bridge, but there are no takers.

<em>Under cover of darkness, the five accomplices set out to steal Sir
Oinkcelot.  When they lug the pig back to Homer's car, Homer starts
playing with its tail, noticing that even if you pull it straight, it
curls right back up again.  He does it repeatedly until the pig chomps
on his hand in annoyance.  Homer has to be restrained from harming the
poor innocent pig.

<em>Bart and Lisa, meanwhile, are watching the Krusty the Klown Show. it's

says she's heard about it already: "This is the one where Scratchy
finally gets Itchy!"  Bart is suitably impressed.
</em>
<em>Itchy is tied to a stake, and he looks glum.  Scratchy rubs his hands in
delight, then reaches for a crate next to him.  He puts sticks of
dynamite under the mouse's eyelids and in his ears.  He fashions a
Lincolnian hat and beard out of plastic explosive and slaps them rudely
on Itchy, attaching grenades to his ears as crude parodies of earrings.
Itchy stares up in horror as a shadow looms over his face: Scratchy is
turning a wheel, adjusting the angle of two atomic bombs so that their
sharpened tips point directly at Itchy's eyes.  Crates of TNT are
stacked around the atomic bombs.  Lighting the fuses on all the
dynamite, he hails a taxi, and leaves.
</em>
<em>Slowly, the fuse burns down.  Itchy tries in vain to escape, his legs
struggling.  Bart and Lisa watch, transfixed.  "My purpose in life is to
witness this moment," says Bart, grasping Lisa's hand.  We see a close-
up of Itchy's sweaty face as the inevitable draws inexorably closer.

<em>Suddenly the TV screen goes blank.  Bart and Lisa scream, horrified.
One of the nerds rises from behind the TV, holding a plug in each hand.
"We need the outlet for our rock tumbler," he explains.  "Plug it in,
Plug it in!" the two cry frantically.  "What, the rock tumbler or the
TV?"  "The TV, the TV!"  The nerd makes it so.
</em>
<em>But it is too late.  A mushroom cloud is all that's left on the TV, with
"THE END" written in red superimposed on it.  The children in Krusty's
audience cheer wildly.  "Wow!" exclaims Krusty, "They'll never let us
show that again, not in a million years!"  Bart and Lisa are aghast.
</em>
 <b>Bart: </b>[<i>sharpening knives</i>] Dad, start diggin' some nerd holes!
 <b>Lisa: </b>[<i>plaintively</i>] It's bad enough that they put their retainers in

       harmony, right, Marge?
<b>Marge: </b>No, I want those geeks outta my house!
-- Who can argue with that?, "Homer Goes to College"

<em>The only recourse is to get the nerds back into college, thinks Homer,
with a zany scheme of some sort.  The nerds aren't sure about the "zany"
idea, but Homer ignores them: "I got it!  We're gonna fix it so you guys
save the Dean's life!"
</em>
<em>In the next scene, Homer is behind the wheel, driving with a determined
look on his face.  He checks his watch, seeing "4:59", and says,
"Perfect."  He fishtails around the corner.

<em>The Dean is just leaving, closing the door on his way out.  He whistles
as he strolls down the path to the parking lot.  The nerds are hiding
behind a nearby bush.

-- I hope he's insured, "Homer Goes to College"

<em>In the Springfield General Hospital, Homer and the nerds stand beside
the Dean's bed.  Homer apologizes for the "running-you-over prank", and
he admits that all the other pranks were his idea too.  "I'm the one who
should be expelled."  The Dean is touched by Homer's honesty, and he
wonders if perhaps he's been a bit of an ogre himself.  "Yes you have,"
Homer confirms quietly.
</em>
<em>The Dean magnanimously offers to readmit the nerds and to forget that
the whole silly incident ever happened.  Just then, Dr. Hibbert walks in
with the Dean's prosthetic replacement hip.  It breaks in his hands, so
the Doctor jovially informs him he'll have to go easy on it.
</em>
<em>The nerds move back into room 222, and check their answering machine.
"Number of messages received: zero," it says, and the three sigh with
relief.  They thank Homer for getting them back into college, and he
says, "The important thing is that we wrapped up all the loose ends."
</em>
<em>But Homer has forgotten why he was at college in the first place: "So,
in conclusion, good luck on tomorrow's big final exam," says the Nuclear
Physics 101 lecturer.  "Exam?!  This is just like one of those bad
dreams," Homer says from his seat in the back row; he then glances down,
noticing he's wearing only his underwear.
</em>
<b>Nerd 2: </b>What are you going to do, Mr. Simpson?
 <b>Homer: </b>Actually, I've been working on a plan.  During the exam, I'll
        hide under some coats, and hope that somehow everything will
        work out.
<b>Nerd 2: </b>[<i>determined</i>] Or, with our help, you can cram like you've never
        crammed before!
 <b>Homer: </b>Whatever.  Either way is good.
-- I'm not picky, "Homer Goes to College"

<em>Homer goes to the library and takes out a wheelbarrow full of books.
The nerds tie his eyes open and hold a book in front of him.  He falls
asleep while reading another book, and one of the nerds slaps him
lightly on the cheek to wake him.  Reflexively, Homer drives his fist
into the nerd's unfortunate face, and falls back asleep.
</em>
<em>In the exam, Homer is one of the last to leave, but he hands in his
paper with a smile, clicking his heels joyously.  The instructor glances
at his answers, and stamps a circled red "F" on his paper.
</em>
<em>The nerds are discontented with Homer's performance.
</em>

 <b>Homer: </b>[<i>whining</i>] Oh, I'm going to lose my job just 'cause I'm
        dangerously unqualified!

        to change your grade.

<em>Bart is impressed at Homer's ability, and Homer is quick to redirect

<b>Nerd 2: </b>No we didn't.
 <b>Homer: </b>Oh.  Then I learned the real value of college is to study, and
        work hard.
  <b>Lisa: </b>No you didn't.  You only passed your course by cheating, which
        you always taught us was wrong.

<em>Homer drives off to his next engagement -- a birthday party at
Milhouse's.  The children cheer as he skids onto the lawn, losing a tire
and crashing into a tree.  A second later, he flies out the windshield
and lands face down in front of the porch.  "Hey, hey," he moans weakly.

       Lube and cohost the Ace Awards.
<b>Lenny: </b>Wow!  Jiffy Lube!
 <b>Carl: </b>Boy, you're really running yourself ragged.
<b>Homer: </b>Yeah.  When I started this clown thing, I thought it would be
       nothing but glory.  You know, the glory of being a clown.  I tell
       you, it's hard, tiring work.  But when I see the smiles on their

           about other famous people that include me in some way.
    <b>Homer: </b>Er, can't, I gotta go distract bulls at a rodeo.
     <b>Dick: </b>Hey, me too.  We can go together.
    <b>Homer: </b>Um...no, I'm going a different way than you, Dick.
     <b>Dick: </b>Heh heh, your...churlish attitude reminds me of a time I was

<b>Vittorio: </b>Sorry I have to do this, Krusty.  [<i>pulls a gun</i>]
           [<i>points it at Homer, cocks trigger</i>]
          I cannot do it.  To murder a funny man of such genius would be
          a crime.  Ah, tell you what, Krusty: do for me my favorite
          trick where you ride the little bike for me through the loop,
          and I will let you live.
   <b>Homer: </b>Oh, but I've never been able to do that --

           [<i>trigger cocks more</i>] OK.
-- The power of persuasion, "Homer the Clown"

<em>Homer grabs a little bike and frets, "I'll never be able to do this
trick.  Never!"  At Vittorio's prodding, he balances on the bike and
succeeds in riding it towards the loop.  "Hey!  I'm doing it, I'm doing
it!" he cries gleefully, riding up the loop -- but as he gets to the
top, he slides back down to the bottom again.  "Ta da," he finishes
lamely.
</em>
<b>Vittorio: </b>The fact that you did not do the trick well is the biggest
          insult of all -- [<i>cocks gun</i>]
  <b>Krusty: </b>[<i>bursting in</i>] Hey guys, I came to -- oh, you've got a deadly
          game of cat and mouse going.  I'll come back.
    <b>Legs: </b>[<i>gasps</i>] I'm seeing double here: four Krustys!
   <b>Homer: </b>Krusty!  Oh thanks, thanks a lot.  You came here to save me!
  <b>Krusty: </b>[<i>slowly</i>] Yeah, that's what I did.
<b>Vittorio: </b>My apologies to you.  I almost made a grievous error.  [<i>cocks
          gun at Krusty</i>] Goodbye, Krusty.
  <b>Krusty: </b>Wait: he can't kill anybody if he doesn't know which one is
          the real Krusty.
           [<i>grabs Homer by the head and plays the shell game with
          himself and Homer</i>]
<b>Vittorio: </b>I am confused.
   <b>Homer: </b>Heh heh.  Good one, Krusty.
           [<i>Vittorio cocks the gun at Krusty</i>]
  <b>Krusty: </b>Oh, crap.
-- That's putting it mildly, "Homer the Clown"

<em>Vittorio menaces, "Because of that disrespectful display, I shall now
kill both of you -- unless you _both_ go through the loop...together!"
The two klowns moan at the thought, but they try it, Krusty riding,
Homer perched on top.  In his fear and in his attempt to hold tight,
Homer covers Krusty's eyes with his hands.  Krusty admonishes him, but
they miss the loop entirely and ride up a pool cue right onto the pool
table.  They ride straight into the racked-up Boston balls -- and sink
every one of them.  The Italians are visibly impressed.
</em>
<em>The antics don't stop there, however.  The two klowns jump across a gap
onto the bar; Homer's head plays "The Godfather" theme music on the wine
glasses that dangle from the roof.  "Ah!" gasp the Italians.  Krusty
sees that the part of the bar that lifts up so the bartender can get out
is raised.  Thinking quickly, he knocks it closed with seltzer.  The
Italians even applaud, but Vittorio moans, "Ah, but without the loop it
is nothing," cocking his gun again.
</em>
<em>He's spoken too quickly -- Krusty and Homer fly off the bar, straight
towards the loop, and whizz around and around it many times.  They fly
off together and skillfully land in the "Ta da!" pose; the miniature
bike flies towards them, and Krusty, although he opens his mouth to
catch it, is beaten to the punch by Homer, who swallows it and makes the
bell ring by opening his mouth.
</em>
<b>Italians: </b>Yay, Krustys!  [<i>applauding</i>]
<b>Vittorio: </b>Grazie, grazie.  You have a brought great joy to this old
          Italian stereotype.
    <b>Legs: </b>No, no, Don Vittorio, you're not --
<b>Vittorio: </b>Yes, I am, I know it, I am.  Anyway, thank you, Krusty.
  <b>Krusty: </b>You're welcome.  So, uh, we're even now, huh?
<b>Vittorio: </b>No, we just won't kill you.  But you still owe us the money.
          [<i>ominous</i>] $48.
  <b>Krusty: </b>[<i>hands him a bill</i>] Here's $50.

   I want to share something with you:
   The three little sentences that will get you through life.
      Number 1:  [whispers] Cover for me.
      Number 2:  Oh, good idea, Boss!
      Number 3:  It was like that when I got here.
   -- Homer tells Bart the secret, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''
   
<em> ``Hey, this &lt;is&gt; good stuff.''  Homer drags Bart into the bathroom
</em><em> to teach him to shave.  Bart's face is lathered as he watches Homer
</em><em> finish with ``the little spot under your nose.''
</em>   
   Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares,
   and stick one there... and there... and any place you're bleeding...
   there... and there... Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on
   your face.
   -- Homer teaches Bart how to shave, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''
   
<em> Next comes the after-shave.  Homer slaps it on and screams in pain.
</em><em> ``Ooh, ahh, eeh, yaaargh!  Rrrrrr.  Ooh, yargh!  You son-of-a-ohhh!  Eee!''
</em><em> ``And that's how we shave.''  Bart accidentally knocks over the
</em><em> after shave.  ``Why you little!''  Bart quickly says, ``It was like
</em><em> that when I got here!''  Homer embraces him.  ``Oh, that's my boy!''
</em><em>
</em><em> Next on the list is listening to Lisa play her sax.  Homer comes into
</em><em> Lisa's room, and she offers to stop playing.  Homer asks her to continue.
</em><em> Though confused, she does so.  Homer cries at her melancholy music, but
</em><em> her tune changes to something more upbeat, and Homer sings and dances.
</em>   
   Oh I want to be in that rumba
   When the saints go over there!
   -- Homer sings to Lisa's sax playing,
      ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''
   
<em> Next is, ``Make videotape for Maggie.''  Homer pays a visit to Ned Flanders.
</em>   
   Ned:   Simpson, what a pleasant surprise.  We were just pulling taffy.
   Homer: Gee, the fun never stops at the Flanders house, does it.
   Ned:   Heh heh, no sirree-bob!
   -- Homer borrows Ned's camcorder, ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''
   
<em> Homer borrows Ned's camcorder, and Ned invites Homer's family over for
</em><em> a barbecue tomrrow.  Homer declines, then reconsiders...
</em>   
   Homer: I'll even bring the thickest juciest T-bones you've ever seen.
   Ned:   Mm mm.  Sounds terrif!
   Homer: Heh, the joke's on him!  I'll be dead by then!
   -- Ned invites Homer over for a cookout,
      ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''
   
<em> At home, Homer sets up the camera and begins recording.
</em>   
   Ahem.  This is a videotape for my daughter Maggie.  Hi, Maggie!  I'm
   speaking to you from beyond the grave.  Woooooooo!  Hee hee hee, hope
   that didn't scare you.  Well, Maggie, you're grown-up now, and unless
   you taped over this, you're probably wondering what kind of man
   your father was.  He was a simple man, a kind man, a gentle man who
   loved his children and... [phone rings]  D'oh!  [answers] Hello!
   Yeah, he's here, who is this? [scratches his butt] ... Bart's friend
   Milhouse?  Bart!  Get your butt down here!
   -- Homer tries to make a tape for Maggie,
      ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''
   
<em> The next item is ``Make peace with Dad''.  Homer pays a visit to Grampa
</em><em> at the Retirement Home.
</em>   
   Homer:  Dad, we've never been too close, have we.
   Grampa: Not to my knowledge.
   Homer:  Never once went fishing or played catch or even hugged each other.
   Grampa: We never danced the hootchie-koo, either.  Whatcher point?
   -- Homer reconciles with his father,
      ``One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish''
   
<em> Homer tells Grampa he loves him, and the two embrace.  Homer says he
</em><em> has to go, but Grampa insists they've got a lot of catching up to do.
</em><em> Grampa prevails on Homer to go fishing; later, they play catch and
</em><em> wrestle.  (While doing these things, Homer crosses things off his list
</em><em> he no longer has time to do.)  Homer finally pulls himself away as
</em><em> Grampa presses his face against the car window.  ``I love you, son!''
</em><em> Mumbles Homer, ``Gee, the old guy's a little love-starved.''
</em><em> Hoping to make up for lost time, Homer puts the pedal to the metal,
</em><em> but gets pulled over.  He tells the two cops to give him a ticket,
</em><em> but they don't take kindly to being ordered around and throw him
</em><em> into the slammer.

   Marge: Sometimes it's fun to use candles.

<em> (`Sam Hill' is an old euphemism for `hell'.)  Burns demands to have

          What's wrong?
<b>Chalmers:</b> [<i>calmly</i>] Nothing, I just bought myself a car.
 <b>Skinner:</b> Oh.  Oh good.  This'll sound crazy, but at first I, I thought

<b>Chalmers:</b> SKINNER!!
 <b>Skinner:</b> What?  What!?
<b>Chalmers:</b> Ah, you're getting paranoid.
-- Just keeping you on your toes, "Lisa's Date With Density"

<em>Chalmers takes Skinner out to the parking lot to show his new set of
wheels.
</em>
You know, I used to think a car was just a way of getting from point A
to point B -- and on weekends, point C.  But that was the old me. That
man died the moment I laid eyes on a 1979 Honda Accord.
-- Chalmers, practical and emotional, "Lisa's Date With Density"

<em>Skinner admires Chalmers' old, tannish brown pride.
</em>
I've always admired car owners and I hope to be one myself as soon as I

-- Perhaps it's best for everybody this way, "Lisa's Date With Density"

<em>Skinner calms him down and says he could find a replacement.  Moments
later, he finds a blue Hyundai and tries to swipe the "H" from it

screwdriver and he and Chalmers flee.

<em>Meanwhile, at the Kwik-E-Mart, Ned is buying groceries from Apu.
Making sure he's not observed, Homer gets a doughnut from the
"Self-Serve" doughnut cabinet and fiddles with it, chuckling.  He
nonchalantly goes to check out, but Apu soon realizes that there's
something wrong.  It seems that Homer tried to sneak various other
candies on top this doughnut to pass them off as sprinkles.

-- Give me your money, your baseball, and your life, "Bart the Fink"

We are gathered here today to mourn the passing of Herschel Shmoikel
Krustofsky, beloved entertainer and dear friend... [<i>perking up</i>]
Hi, I'm Troy McClure!  You may remember me from other show business
funerals such as "Andre the Giant: We Hardly Knew Ye", and "Shemp
Howard: Today We Mourn a Stooge"!
-- Troy McClure at the funeral, "Bart the Fink"

<em>Troy introduces his first speaker, Sideshow Mel.
</em>
I'm going to miss you, Krusty.  Me and all the other Sideshows...
except Sideshow Bob.
-- Melvin van Horne at Krusty's funeral, "Bart the Fink"

In the midst of our sorrow, we can take solace in the fact that your
elevated blood alcohol level probably helped you burn up quicker.
-- Melvin van Horne at Krusty's funeral, "Bart the Fink"

<em>Sideshow Mel unveils a simple memorial to Krusty.  Troy introduces
Bob Newhart, who mutters his way through a speech.  Homer sheds
a tear.
</em>
Well, that's the funeral, folks.  We'll be sitting shivah at the
friar's club at 7:00 and again at 10.  You must be over 18 for the
10:00.  It gets a little blue.
-- Troy McClure closes Krusty's funeral, "Bart the Fink"

<em>Bart watches the news at home where Kent Brockman reports on the
unveiling of the new Krusty stamp, where people were asked to vote
on two different signs: one of his heartwarming smile, or of his
fiery death.  They picked the first one.
</em>
<em>Bart repeatedly pulls a string on a Krusty doll, which nets him
repeated groans from Krusty.  (Eww...) Homer tries to console him.
</em>
<b>Homer:</b> Don't let Krusty's death get you down, boy.  People die all the
       time, just like that. [<i>snap</i>] Why, you could wake up dead
       tomorrow.
        [<i>pause</i>]
       Well, goodnight.
-- Aw, I messed up again, "Bart the Fink"

<em>Bart, while walking, spots a pickup truck carrying nets, and someone
with a similar appearence to Krusty.  He runs home and talks to
Marge.
</em>
 <b>Bart:</b> Mom, I just saw Krusty!
<b>Marge:</b> Yes, dear, in your mind.
 <b>Bart:</b> No, on the street.
<b>Marge:</b> On the street in your mind.
 <b>Bart:</b> Why won't you believe me?
<b>Marge:</b> Sweetheart, sometimes when people die, you just want them to
       be alive so badly you see them everywhere.  I went through the
       same thing when Lyndon Johnson died.
-- Who the hell is Lyndon Johnson?, "Bart the Fink"

<em>At the hospital, Bart sees the same man walk out of Dr. Hibbert's
office, with prescribed pills for queasiness.
</em>
      <b>Bart:</b> Dr. Hibbert, who was that man?
   <b>Hibbert:</b> [<i>chuckles</i>] Why, Bart, telling you that would violate the
            patient-doctor privilege, just as if I were to tell you
            that Jasper here has five seconds to live.
    <b>Jasper:</b> What did he say?
<b>Mrs. Glick:</b> He said I'm next!
-- Jasper Moleman?, "Bart the Fink"

<em>Bart spots the same man scuba diving for lobsters.  He talks to Lisa
about it.
</em>
<b>Lisa:</b> Bart, you're seeing Krusty everywhere because you want to tell
      him you're sorry for causing his death.  Would it help if I told
      you you're not responsible for Krusty's death.
<b>Bart:</b> Yes.  Yes, it would.
<b>Lisa:</b> Well, I can't.  You'll just have to learn to live with your
      mental problem.
-- Heartless Lisa, "Bart the Fink"

<em>Bart, however, deduces that if he saw Krusty carrying nets, motion
sickness pills, and scuba diving, it can only lead to one thing.
He and Lisa head for the docks.
</em>
<b>McAllister:</b> Arr, I've got some customers.  Call me back, Ishmael.
-- "Bart the Fink"

<em>Bart blows up a balloon of Krusty and asks "Have you seen this man?"
McAllister recognizes it as Handsome Pete who dances for nickels.
A short guy with a Krusty-like face comes in and plays "Sailor's
Hornpipe".  But Lisa says, "No, we're looking for this man: Krusty
the Klown."  "Narr, narr, narr," McAllister responds.
</em>
It's no use, Bart.  We've looked up and down these docks, from Pier One
to that Pier One by Pier 17.
-- Lisa, on the search for Krusty, "Bart the Fink"

<em>But Bart spots something: a bounced check from a man with the exact
same signature as Krusty, Rory B. Bellows, slip eight.  Bart gives
Handsome Pete a quarter.  McAllister responds "Arr, not a quarter!
He'll be dancin' for hours."  Bart and Lisa run to slip eight.
</em>
<b>Lisa:</b> Are you Rory B. Bellows?
<b>Rory:</b> Yes.
<b>Bart:</b> How about Krusty the Klown?
<b>Rory:</b> Sorry, I don't do impressions.
<b>Bart:</b> Well, if you're not Krusty, how come you have the exact same
      signature as him?
<b>Rory:</b> I'm Rory Bellows, I tell you!  And I got some real corroborating
      evidence, over here, by the throttle!
       [<i>turns the ship up to full throttle and tries to get away,</i>
<i>       but his ship is still tied to the dock</i>]
      You know, you kids coulda said something instead of letting me
      make an ass of myself.
-- You don't need _us_ to do that, "Bart the Fink"

<em>Rory has a pacemaker scar and a third nipple just like Krusty.  He
says he is Krusty, but he doesn't want to be anymore, and that's
why he faked his death.  Krusty bailed out just before the plane
crashed and jumped into a carefully placed net (well, he hit the
wall first).
</em>
<b>Bart:</b> Well, now that we've blown your cover, I guess you gotta come
      back and do your show again!
<b>Lisa:</b> Or kill us...
       [<i>they both nervously giggle</i>]
-- Way to go Lise, "Bart the Fink"

<b>Krusty:</b> I won't be coming back, kids.  I got a sweet life here.  The
        sea air is cleaning my lungs.  The sun is toasting my pale skin
        a healthy brown, and most important, I learned that I don't
        need money to be happy.  All that high living just distracted
        <b>me from my true calling in life:</b> salvaging sunken barges for
        scrap iron.  Sorry, kids, there's nothing left for me on dry
        land anymore.
  <b>Bart:</b> But, Krusty, what about all the kids who depend on you to
        brighten up their afternoon.  Are you gonna turn your back on
        them?
<b>Krusty:</b> Yes!
-- Good answer, "Bart the Fink"

<em>Krusty sails off, but Bart and Lisa follow him, saying a bunch of
stuff to make him covet his old life.  When he sails away, Bart and
Lisa call after him.
</em>
         [<i>Krusty sails out of view</i>]
  <b>Lisa:</b> What about the great feeling you get from knowing you're better
        than regular people?
  <b>Bart:</b> What about being an illiterate clown who's still more respected
        than all the educators in the country put together!
         [<i>Krusty throws down his anchor</i>]
<b>Krusty:</b> Yeah!  I'm not gonna let those guys hog all the respect while
        I'm out here in this stinking tub.
         [<i>dives into the water and swims to shore</i>]
        That's just what those eggheads want!  Well, forget it

   <b>B+L:</b> Yay!
-- Forget those PC thugs, "Bart the Fink"

<em>Krusty shakes off his yellow paint, fake beard, and fake nose (looks
like his real nose is red), then puffs back out his hair.  He, Bart,
and Lisa walk off together.
</em>
  <b>Bart:</b> So, Krusty, what are you gonna do about your tax problems?
<b>Krusty:</b> Don't sweat it.  The life of Rory B. Bellows is insured for a

   Chalmers: We're dropping the geography requirement.

             It's proving to be an embarrassment.
   Skinner:  Very good.  Back to the three R's.

</em><em> known as ``Whacking Day''.  Founded by Jebediah Springfield in 1775,

<em> Bart is enrolled in the local Christian fundamentalist school, but

</em><em> At the dinner table, Bart considers a future as a taster of

</em><em> Meanwhile, Lisa fails to impress upon Homer the evils of Whacking
</em><em> Day.
</em><em>
</em><em> Bart relaxes on the couch while Lisa heads for school, but Marge
</em><em> tells Bart to be in class before the bell rings.  Class is set up in
</em><em> the garage, with a blackboard, teacher's desk, student's desk, and a
</em><em> very loud bell which startles both Bart and Marge.  Marge enjoys the
</em><em> r\^ole of teacher, opening the class with formal introductions.
</em><em>
</em><em> Math instruction is interrupted by a guest speaker:  Grampa Simpson,
</em><em> who tells about his r\^ole in World War II.  Trapped behind enemy
</em><em> lines, he spent the war posing as a (female) cabaret singer.  But he
</em><em> is found out.
</em>   
   Ach du lieber!  Das is nicht eine Booby!
   -- Adolf Hitler, ``Whacking Day''
   
<em> When pressed, Grampa insists the story was `mostly' true, especially
</em><em> the part about wearing a dress.  The lesson is interrupted by
</em><em> Homer's high-speed entry into the garage.  Fortunately, Homer stops
</em><em> just in the nick of time.
</em><em>
</em><em> Homer shows off to Marge his new whacking stick.  Marge is excited.
</em><em>
</em><em> Back in class...
</em>   
   Marge: Bart, I'd like you to read this copy of ``Johnny Tremaine''.
          It's a book I read as a girl.
   Bart:  A book!?  Pfffft.
   Marge: I think you might like this.
          It's about a boy who goes to war.
          His hand is deformed in an accident.
   Bart:  Deformed?  Why didn't you say so!

</em><em> Barney whacks imaginary snakes.
</em><em>
</em><em> Diamond Joe Quimby appears, one of his sidekicks carrying a
</em><em> briefcase full of pre-whacked snakes.
</em><em>
</em><em> After some lascivious whacking-day banter between Homer and Marge,
</em><em> Lisa once again begs Homer not to take part.
</em><em>
</em><em> Snakes look on nervously as Diamond Joe Quimby introduces Larry
</em><em> [sic] White to whack off, err, kick off the festivities.  When Barry
</em><em> White learns what Whacking Day is about, he announces, ``You people

<em> While snakes make their escape ahead of the advancing crowd, Bart

</em><em> through vibrations in the ground, so by playing music with lots of
</em><em> bass, they can draw the snakes into the safety of the Simpsons home.
</em><em> Lisa can't find any suitable records, but she fortunately spots
</em><em> Barry White walking past, and he offers his assistance by singing in

<b>Narrator: </b>Ruth Powers was tried in Springfield Superior Court.  The
          judge dismissed her ex-husband's auto theft charges and forced
          him to pay all back child support.  Mr. Powers blamed the
          outcome on his lawyer, one Lionel Hutz.

          paid eight dollars for his thirty-two hours of babysitting.
          He was glad to get it.
          Marge Simpson was charged with a violation of penal code
          section 618A: Wanton Destruction of Precious Antique Cans.
          She was ordered to pay fifty cents to replace the cans, and
          $2000 in punitive damages and mental anguish.

<em> Homer refuses to sell Lurleen's contract.
</em><em>
</em><em> In Lurleen's dressing room, Homer asks if there's anything she needs.
</em><em> Lurleen bolts the door shut and kisses him.  Homer stops.  ``My whole
</em><em> romantic life is flashing before my eyes!''  And it does.  It involves
</em><em> lots of slapping.  Then came Marge.  Homer tells Lurleen that his goal
</em><em> was to share her voice with other people, and he's done it.  ``I'd better
</em><em> get out of here before I lose my family.''  He leaves, then pokes his
</em><em> head back in the door.  ``Just so I don't wonder.  You would've gone all
</em><em> the way with me, wouldn't you?''  She nods.
</em><em>
</em><em> Homer approaches the agent.
</em>   
   Now before we negotiate, I have to tell you I'm desperate to unload Lurleen,
   and I'll take any offer.
   -- Homer Simpson, Master Bargainer, ``Colonel Homer''
   
<em> He sells the contract for $50.
</em><em>
</em><em> At Homer, Marge sits in bed (naked) watching the incredibly feeble
</em><em> ``Ya-Hoo!'' program.  Homer arrives home.  ``Is there any room in the
</em><em> bed for a gad-durned fool?''  ``Always has been.''  While Lurleen sings
</em><em> ``Stand By Your Manager'', Homer undresses (but keeps the hat) and gets
</em><em> into bed.  Her song concludes, ``I hope that Marge knows just how lucky
</em><em> she is.''  Marge says, ``I do'', and the two kiss.  Homer tosses his hat
</em><em> onto the camera.

<em>On the TV...
</em>
<b>Announcer: </b>Ladies and gentlemen, it's "Up Late with McBain".  I'm your
           announcer, Corporal Obergruppenfuehrer Wolfcastle.  And
           heeere's McBain!
   <b>McBain: </b>Ja, thank you, ja, that's nice.  Let's say hello to my music
           guy, Skoey.  [<i>Skoey bows</i>] That is some outfit, Skoey.  It
           makes you look like a homosexual.
            [<i>Audience boos</i>]
           Whoa, maybe you all are homosexuals too!
     <b>Bart: </b>This is horrible.
     <b>Lisa: </b>The FOX network has sunk to a new low.
-- Thank God for FOX, "Cape Feare"

<em>Marge comes in with the mail.
</em>
<b>Marge: </b>Lisa, you got a letter.
 <b>Lisa: </b>It's from my pen-pal Anya!  [<i>reads</i>]
 <b>Anya: </b>[<i>voice over</i>] Dear Lisa, as I write this, I am very sad.  Our
       president has been overthrown and
        [<i>voice changes to that of a man</i>]
       replaced by the benevolent general Krull.  All hail Krull and his
       glorious new regime!  Sincerely, Little Girl.
-- Hmm, sudden tone change, "Cape Feare"

<em>Bart gets a letter as well.  Except it's only five words: "I'M GOING TO
KILL YOU", scrawled in thick red ink.  Bart quakes.  Scene switches to a
pair of hands, the left one holding a pointed knife.  The knife is used
to prick a finger on the right hand, drawing blood.  A "Things to do"
list shows "Threaten Bart" and "Do laundry" written in blood, and both
items get checked off -- in blood.  As an afterthought, "Buy corn
holders" is added to the list.
</em>
<em>Just then, an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon, "Spay Anything", comes on the
TV.  Itchy stands in front of a sign, "WE PAY YOUR PETS $75", at
"Itchy's Cat Hospital", and Scratchy walks by.  Envisioning a quick
profit, Scratchy rushes into the building.  Itchy follows him in, to
reveal an "S" in front of "PAY" that was formerly concealed.  Scratchy
is shackled onto a table by two big canine orderlies, and Dr. Itchy
turns on the spay ray!  Slowly, slowly, the ray inches closer to
Scratchy's doodle.  Frantically, he glances over and sees the plug
nearby!  Magically, his tongue extends towards the plug, pulling it from
the wall in the nick of time.  Just then, Dr. Itchy returns and
reinserts the plug.  The spay ray slices Scratchy to bits which slide
off the table...Scratchy's eyes blink twice, convulsively, as the life
seeps from his body.
</em>
<em>Lisa is very amused, but Bart feels the specter of the letter writer
cast a shadow over his heart.
</em>
<em>Homer reads another letter and panics for a moment, but then he realizes
it's for Bart: "DIE BART DIE", again in red ink.  Many letters are shown
laid out on the table, all in red ink, except for one conspicuous
letter, which says "I KILL YOU SCUM" in black ink instead of red.  Homer
confesses having written it after Bart somehow put a tattoo reading
"WIDE LOAD" on Homer's butt.  Everyone laughs hard, even Marge.  Nelson
happens to be at the window, and he laughs too.
</em>
But who'd want to hurt me?  I'm this century's Dennis the Menace.
-- Bart, "Cape Feare"

<em>Homer suggests, "It's probably the person you least suspect," but Lisa
doesn't think much of that idea.
</em>
 <b>Abe: </b>I say we call Matlock.  He'll find the culprit.  It's probably
      that evil Gavin MacLeod or George "Goober" Lindsay.
<b>Bart: </b>[<i>dismissively</i>] Grampa, Matlock's not real.
 <b>Abe: </b>Neither are my teeth, but I can still eat corn on the cob, if

kill ya.
-- Milhouse the informer to Bart, "Cape Feare"

<em>Just then, Nelson pulls down Bart's pants, and a horde of kids suddenly
appear, chanting "Fatty-fat fat fat!" in unison.

<em>Marge appeals to Chief Wiggum for action, but the Chief is reluctant.
</em>
<b>Wiggum: </b>I'd like to help you ma'am, but, heh heh, I'm afraid there's no
        law against mailing threatening letters.
 <b>Marge: </b>[<i>indignantly</i>] I'm pretty sure there is.
<b>Wiggum: </b>Hah!  The day I take cop lessons from Ma Kettle --
   <b>Lou: </b>Hey, she's right, Chief.  [<i>shows him "Springfield Law"</i>]
<b>Wiggum: </b>Well, shut my mouth.  It's _also_ illegal to put squirrels down

      irritating phone calls to for years?
<b>Bart: </b>Linda Lavin?
<b>Lisa: </b>No, someone who _didn't_ deserve it.

<em>It's Moe!  Lisa calls up, tells Moe that they know he's behind it, and
curtly informs him to knock it off.  Moe assures her he'll take care of
it.  He releases the pandas he's been holding captive.
</em>
<em>Bart thinks more on his predicament.  "You're out there somewhere," he
says, but implores, "Where?  Where?"  That "somewhere" is the
Springfield State Prison, and the someone is...

...Sideshow Bob!
</em>
<em>Bob is writing another letter, "SEE YOU SOON BART".  Afterward, he
decides to write to "Reader's Digest".
</em>
  <b>Bob: </b>[<i>narrating aloud</i>] Dear "Life in these United States", a funny

<b>Snake: </b>Use a pen, Sideshow Bob.
-- The pen is mightier than the sword -- except when it runs out of
    blood, "Cape Feare"

<em>[End of Act One.  Time: 6:08]
</em>
<em>At the parole hearings, the committee grants parole to Snake, the
reformed convict.  Next up is "Bob Terwilliger, a. k. a.  Sideshow Bob."
Sideshow Bob says goodbye to his cellmate.
</em>
  <b>Bob: </b>Take care, Snake.  May the next time we meet be under more...

<b>Snake: </b>[<i>not understanding</i>] Guh?
  <b>Bob: </b>Take care.
<b>Snake: </b>Buh.
-- Never made it to grade 10, "Cape Feare"

<em>In the court room, Sideshow Bob's parole hearing is underway.  Chief
Wiggum takes the stand.
</em>
<b>Wiggum: </b>[<i>miffed</i>] Sideshow Bob has no decency.  He called me "Chief

         [<i>everyone laughs</i>]
        Heh, now I get it.  That's good.
-- Guess you _didn't_ have to be there, "Cape Feare"

<em>Selma's up next, and she explains, "Sideshow Bob tried to kill me on our
honeymoon."  The crowd whispers among themselves, shocked at the
revelation.  But Bob's lawyer asks craftily, "How many people in this
court are thinking of killing her right now?"  A few spectators glumly
put their hands up.  "Be honest," he admonishes, and many more hands go
up, even a priest's.  Even Patty raises her hand: "Aw, she's always
leaving the toilet seat up."
</em>
 <b>Lawyer: </b>Robert, if released, would you pose any threat to one Bart
         Simpson?
    <b>Bob: </b>[<i>barely in control</i>] Bart Simpson?  Ha!  The spirited little
         scamp who twice foiled my evil schemes and [<i>maliciously</i>] sent
         me to this dank, urine-soaked hellhole?
<b>Officer: </b>Uh, we object to the term "urine-soaked hellhole" when you
         could have said, "peepee-soaked heckhole".
    <b>Bob: </b>Cheerfully withdrawn.
-- We aim to please, "Cape Feare"

<em>But the lawyer presses on.
</em>
 <b>Lawyer: </b>But what about that tattoo on your chest?  Doesn't it say, "Die
         Bart, Die?"
    <b>Bob: </b>[<i>conciliatorily</i>] No, that's German for "The Bart, The."
          [<i>The spectators laugh, understanding</i>]
<b>Officer: </b>No one who speaks German could be an evil man.
-- Remember World War II?, "Cape Feare"

<em>Sideshow Bob's parole is granted.  With his new-found freedom, Bob
decides to catch a movie, "Ernest Goes Somewhere Cheap."  Showing
flagrant disregard for the other patrons, Bob smokes a cigar openly and
cackles loudly at the inanity on the big screen.
</em>
<em>The Simpsons, too, are at the movie.  Marge is nonplussed: "That man is
so rude."  Homer concurs, moving his own cigar deftly with his lips from
the right side of his mouth to the left.  Homer taps Bob on the
shoulder, warning him, "If you don't mind, we're trying to watch the
movie!"  Just then, Ernest gets his head stuck in a toilet, and Homer
can't contain his mirth.  Now it's Bob's turn to be nonplussed.  He
turns angrily to Homer to berate him.
</em>
<b>Bart+Lisa: </b>Aah!  Sideshow Bob!
     <b>Bart: </b>_You_ wrote me those letters.
    <b>Marge: </b>You awful man!  Stay away from my son.
      <b>Bob: </b>Oh, I'll stay away from your son, all right.  [<i>evilly</i>] Stay

    <b>Homer: </b>[<i>quaking</i>] No!
      <b>Bob: </b>Wait a minute, that's no good.
            [<i>Starts to walk away, then runs back</i>]
           Wait!  I've got a good one now.  Marge, say, "Stay away from
           my son," again.
    <b>Marge: </b>[<i>angrily</i>] No!
      <b>Bob: </b>[<i>groaning</i>] Oh...
-- I hate it when that happens, "Cape Feare"

<em>Bob angrily prepares to carry out some dastardly plan.  He pumps iron
and even participates in a TV exercise program, turning, flexing,
shaking, and bouncing.
</em>
<em>Meanwhile at the Simpson home, Chief Wiggum helps the family set up an
elaborate network of trip strings attached to a Krusty doll.  He assures
them the trap is infallible.
</em>
  <b>Wiggum: </b>Now Sideshow Bob can't get in without _me_ knowing.  And once
          a man is in your home, anything you do to him is nice and
          legal.
   <b>Homer: </b>[<i>nefariously</i>] Is that so?  [<i>calls out window</i>] Oh, Flanders!
          Won't you join me in my kitchen?  Heh, heh, heh...
  <b>Wiggum: </b>Er, it doesn't work if you invite him.

-- Coulda worked, though, "Cape Feare"

<em>Homer decides to enlist the help of a local vigilante.
</em>

-- How to Win Arguments and Influence People, "Cape Feare"

<em>Sideshow Bob becomes more daring.  He drives through the neighborhood in
an ice cream truck, naming the people he won't kill.  When he gets to
the Simpson house, he mentions every name except Bart's, even "that
little baby Simpson".  Homer is overjoyed his life won't be snuffed out,
and he races up to impart the good news to Bart, but Bart only looks
glum.
</em>
<em>Finally, the Simpsons resort to the FBI's Witness Relocation Program.
They promise the Simpsons a new name, a new job, and a whole new
identity.  Homer fantasizes about becoming John Elway, but Marge isn't
sure it's such a good idea.  Homer tries to convince her: "It's a chance
to turn around all our stinkin' lives."  Bart has his own ideas for a
new identity.
</em>
 <b>Bart: </b>I'll be Gus, the lovable chimney-sweep.  Clean as a whistle,
       sharp as a thistle, best in all Westminster.  Yeah!
<b>Homer: </b>Shut up, boy.
-- So much for _that_ new identity, "Cape Feare"

<em>The agents being suggesting possible new locations for the family.
</em>
<b>Agent: </b>We have places your family can hide in peace and security: Cape
       Fear, Terror Lake, New Horrorfield, Screamville --
<b>Homer: </b>[<i>enthusiastically</i>] Ooh, Ice Creamville!
<b>Agent: </b>Er, no, Screamville.
<b>Homer: </b>[<i>scared</i>] Aah!
-- A fertile imagination, "Cape Feare"

<em>One agent suggests a new identity for Homer.
</em>
<b>Agent: </b>Tell you what, sir.  From now on, you'll be, uh, Homer Thompson
       at Terror Lake.  Let's just practise a bit, hmm?  When I say,
       "Hello, Mr. Thompson," you'll say, "Hi."
<b>Homer: </b>Check.
<b>Agent: </b>Hello, Mr. Thompson.
<b>Homer: </b>[<i>stares blankly</i>]
<b>Agent: </b>Remember now, your name is Homer Thompson.
<b>Homer: </b>I gotcha.
<b>Agent: </b>Hello, Mr. Thompson.
<b>Homer: </b>[<i>stares blankly</i>]
        [<i>A long time later</i>]
<b>Agent: </b>[<i>sighs in frustration</i>] Now, when I say, "Hello, Mr. Thompson,"
       and press down on your foot, you smile and nod.
<b>Homer: </b>No problem.
<b>Agent: </b>Hello, Mr. Thompson!  [<i>stomps on Homer's foot a few times</i>]
<b>Homer: </b>[<i>stares blankly</i>]
        [<i>to other agent</i>] I think he's talking to _you_.
-- Some things just won't stick, "Cape Feare"

<em>The details are finally arranged.  The FBI agents give Homer the keys to
a new convertible.  Lisa is delighted to discover "The FBI Light Opera
Society Sings the Complete Gilbert and Sullivan" series of cassettes in
the car.  The whole family sings joyously along to "Three Little Maids"
from "The Mikado".  Little do they know that Sideshow Bob has strapped
himself under their car...of course, the ride isn't so easy for the
villain, what with the speed bumps and scalding coffee Homer throws over
the side of the car.  Even worse...
</em>
<b>Homer: </b>Hey kids, wanna drive through that cactus patch?
 <b>Bart: </b>Yeah!
 <b>Lisa: </b>Yeah!
  <b>Bob: </b>[<i>disguising his voice from under the car</i>] No!
<b>Homer: </b>Well, two against one!
-- That's democracy, "Cape Feare"

<em>Homer drives recklessly through the cacti, much to Sideshow Bob's
chagrin.
</em>
<em>[End of Act Two.  Time: 12:52]
</em>
<em>We see an intro sequence very similar to that from "The Simpsons",
except it's for a show called "The Thompsons".  Instead of showing
Springfield looming over the horizon, we see a sign saying, "Welcome to
Terror Lake" and a pier with houseboats.  A red convertible skids to a
halt, and the Thompson family jump out and rush into one of the
houseboat.  Inside, they all rush to sit on a couch, but once they do, a
load of fish crashes through the roof and covers them.
</em>
<em>Homer exclaims, "Wow, a houseboat!"  He notes that a great advantage of
houseboats is, if you don't like your neighbors, you can pull up the
anchor and sail some place else.  All the neighbors do just this while
the family laughs.
</em>
<em>Sideshow Bob has meanwhile extricated himself from under the car.  He
has the misfortune of stepping onto ground where someone has left a
bunch of rakes lying around.  He steps on several with his oversized
feet; the bone-crunching smash of the rake handle flying into his face
makes him groan.  {The last two rakes he steps on are cut in
syndication.}
</em>
<em>Marge is concerned about the location of Santa's Little Helper, but
Homer has resourcefully tied him up out back -- to a post that has been
sunk into the floor of Terror Lake.
</em>
<b>Marge: </b>[<i>ruefully</i>] We've left it all behind.  How can you make a clean

-- All the loose ends except one, "Cape Feare"

<em>Bart walks down the street, when he hears a voice say coldly, "Hello,
Bart."  It's Sideshow Bob strapped to the bottom of another car.  Bart
asks what Bob wants, but Bob plays innocent: "Surely there's no harm in
laying the middle of a public street?"  Bob didn't figure on the parade
that comes marching along, complete with elephants, as "Terror Lake
celebrates Hannibal crossing the Alps."  Bart rushes home to tell his
parents.
</em>
<b>Homer: </b>[<i>cracks a beer</i>] Ahh!
 <b>Bart: </b>Mom, Dad, I saw Sideshow Bob and he threatened to kill me!

<em>Bart tosses and turns in bed, unable to sleep.  He eyes pop open as his
door opens stealthily and a knife blade appears.  A madman jumps in,
yelling incoherently, and Bart screams.  But it turns out to be Homer,
offering Bart a warm brownie.  Bart admonishes Homer for frightening him
so, and Homer realizes, "Oh, the Sideshow Bob thing."  He apologizes,
kisses Bart and leaves.
</em>
<em>No sooner has Bart closed his eyes that another madman springs into the
room!  But again, it's just Homer, asking Bart if he wants to see his
new chainsaw and hockey mask.
</em>
<em>The lights go out, one by one, on the Thompson's houseboat.  A single
hand appears from the water, grasping at the railing on the boat, as
Sideshow Bob pulls himself aboard, only to step on another rake that
someone has left carelessly lying about.  He tosses it over the side,
brandishes a machette, and cuts the boat loose from the dock.
</em>
<em>He walks into Bart's room and greets him.  Bart calls out to his
parents, but Sideshow Bob has tied everyone up -- even Santa's Little
Helper and Snowball II.  Lisa sees Homer drooling and snoring and
mistakenly thinks he's been drugged.
</em>
<em>Sideshow Bob advances menacingly.  Bart opens the window behind him and
jumps out just as Bob's machette whicker-snickers through the air,
slicing a pillow in two.  Bart runs desperately from one end of the boat
to the other, only to find the water inhabited by alligators and
electric eels.  At last, Bart is trapped.
</em>
 <b>Bob: </b>Well, Bart...any last requests?
<b>Bart: </b>Well, there is one, but...nah.
 <b>Bob: </b>[<i>curious</i>] No, go on.
<b>Bart: </b>Well, you have such a beautiful voice.
 <b>Bob: </b>[<i>arrogantly</i>] Guilty as charged.
<b>Bart: </b>Uh huh.  Anyway, I was wondering if you could sing the entire
      score of the "H.M.S.  Pinafore".
 <b>Bob: </b>Very well, Bart.  I shall send you to heaven before I send you to
      hell.
-- "Cape Feare"

<em>Bob grabs Bart, sits him down, and breaks into song: "We sail the ocean
blue/And our saucy ship's a beauty./We are sober men, and true/And
attentive to our duty..." What Bob doesn't realize is that shortly
before, they passed a sign reading, "Springfield 15 Mi."  If Bart can
stall Bob long enough...
</em>
<em>Bart eats popcorn as Bob sings "I'm called little Buttercup..." The two
do a duet: "What, never?  No, never.  What, never?  [together] Hardly
ever!  He's hardly ever sick at sea..." Bob finishes off with "For He Is
an Englishman", and the audience gives him a standing ovation and some
flowers.  But the fun is over.

<em>At last, the family can return home.  Unfortunately, without Abe's

to beat the Kwik-E-Mart Gougers coached by Apu.  Milhouse plays goal for
the Gougers, his glasses on outside his mask.  "I could have been
equipment manager, but no..." he laments angrily.  Bart stickhandles
flashily towards him, then winds up and takes a slapshot.  It hits
Milhouse's mask right between the eyes, knocking him over.
</em>
<em>Apu helps Milhouse up, but the poor boy seems unconscious.  "Our goalie
cannot stand up," Apu muses, then calls, "Tell you what: get some rope."
Milhouse is tied spreadeagled to the goalposts; he looks up briefly,
only to have his head slump over again.
</em>
<em>A Pigs player slaps the puck down to the other end of the rink and a
giant pile-up ensues.  The puck breaks free and slides slowly down the
ice, straight towards Milhouse.  He blows at it feebly to impede its
progress as Apu calls, "Defense, defense!  Come on, you call that
blowing?"  But Milhouse can only watch helplessly as it slides under him
into the goal.  The referee blows his whistle just as the buzzer goes
with the score now 3-2.  "Oh yes!" cries Wiggum, "We won!  We won!  Um,
unfortunately, because I bet on the other team, heh, we won't be going
for pizza."  His team sighs.
</em>

 <b>Lisa: </b>Wow, Bart, I'm so impressed you were able to give Milhouse a
       concussion.

<em>Bart gets angry and positions himself in front of some garbage on the
floor.  "Aw, you're just jealous because you!  Stink!  At!  Sports!" he
tells Lisa, punctuating his speech with slapshots of garbage at her.
She blocks them all, yelling "Quit it, Bart!"  A can flies off and hits
Apu in the head, whereupon he turns around and sees Lisa fending off
Bart's attack.  "Ooh, you know I wonder...if her skills would transfer
over to the game of hockey.  Well, only one way to be sure."  He throws
a puck down on the ice and calls, "Heads up, little girl!" slapping it
at her.  She screams and ducks, catching it in one hand.  She looks at
it disbelievingly.
</em>
<em>Apu runs towards her joyously: "The goalie of my dreams!"  He hugs her
and says, "Let's try a hard one to make sure it wasn't a fluke.  He goes
back and hits another puck at her which she bats away with a stick.  It
hits Milhouse who cries, "Hey!  Way to knock out my teeth."  Apu
encourages him, "Yeah, that's it, Milhouse, keep up the chatter."

his map: "To remove the spider's curse, simply quote a Bible verse."

he is the only person in the stands not drinking.
</em>
<b>Announcer:</b> ...the windup and a 2-2 pitch.  Oh, no, wait a minute, the
	   batter is calling for time.  Looks like he's going to get
	   himself a new bat.  And now there's a beach ball on the
	   field, and the balls boys are discussing which one of them's
	   going to go get it.
    <b>Homer:</b> [<i>only one not drinking</i>] I never realized how boring this
	   game is.
-- A rude awakening, "Duffless"

<em>At home, Homer marks his 15th dry day.  He notices he's lost weight.
{Later, Homer attends Patty and Selma's home utensil party.}
</em>
<b>Patty:</b> {Thank you all for coming.  We've got some very interesting new
       developments in the field of Supperware.}
<b>Selma:</b> {Uh, huh.  This is the 128-ounce tub.  You can fit your whole
       head in it. [<i>demonstrates and looks at Jub-Jub</i>]  Don't be scared
       Jub-jub; it's momma.}
<b>Homer:</b> {[<i>sotto voce</i>] I would kill everyone in this room for a drop of
       sweet beer.}

<em>Homer attends another Alc-Anon meeting.
</em>
<b>Lovejoy:</b> So Homer, pleas feel free to tell us anything.  There's no
	 judgment here.
  <b>Homer:</b> The other day I was so desperate for a beer I snuck into the
	 football stadium and ate the dirt under the bleachers.
<b>Lovejoy:</b> I cast thee out!
-- You remember Matthew 21:17, "Duffless"

<em>Homer rides along on Lisa's bike, trying not to think about beer.
He sees a Duff billboard of a scantily clad woman next to a beer
bottle ("You know you want it") and Homer turns sharply to avoid
looking at it.  He stops at a railroad crossing, where he sees that
the train rolling past is carrying several boxcars' worth of Duff.
The wheels even seem to be saying "Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug, chug-a-
lug"...  Homer turns away from the railroad and bikes straight into
an empty can of Duff which sends him off his bike looking skyward.
A zeppelin flies overhead, with a marquee reading "Surrender to Duff"
and releases a payload of Duff Bottles. "Nooo!!!!"
</em>
<em>Despite all of that, he makes it.  Shuddering, Homer crosses off the
last day of the month.
</em>
<b>Homer:</b> Thirty days.
<b>Marge:</b> I'm proud of you, Homey.
<b>Homer:</b> Marge, I'm going to Moe's.  Send the kids to the neighbors, I'm
       coming back loaded.  [<i>kisses Marge good-bye</i>]
-- "Duffless"

<b>Marge:</b> Mmmm.  You don't have to start drinking right away.  I waas
       thinking we could go for a bike ride.
<b>Homer:</b> But Marge, the barflies are expecting me.  Larry, and Barney,
       and that guy who calls me Bill.
<b>Marge:</b> But you look better, you don't sweat when you eat any more, and
       look -- [<i>holds up a wad of cash</i>] you've saved more than a
       hundred dollars.  I found it in your pants.
<b>Homer:</b> [<i>snatches money</i>] Yoink!
<b>Marge:</b> Mmmm.

<em>Homer arrives at Moe's.
</em>
     <b>Moe:</b> Well, well.  Look who it is, Mr. "I Don't Need Alky-hol to
	  Enjoy Life."  We hate him, right fellas?
<b>Barflies:</b> [<i>grumble</i>]
   <b>Homer:</b> Moe, give me a beer.
     <b>Moe:</b> Hey everybody, Homer's back.
<b>Barflies:</b> [<i>grumbles</i>]
-- Who cares?, "Duffless"

<em>Moe pours Homer a glass of that wonderful Duff.  Homer lifts it to
his lips, but hesitates to drink it.  He eyes the poor, pathetic
barflies around him: Larry, Smitty (collapsed), and Barney (who
burps).  Then he looks at Moe.
</em>
   <b>Moe:</b> C'mon, Homer, do it for your old pal Moesy.
<b>Barney:</b> But Moe, yesterday you called Homer a worthless sack of --
   <b>Moe:</b> [<i>strikes Barney</i>] Pipe down, rub-a-dub!

 <b>Homer:</b> [<i>setting the glass on the bar</i>] Put it in the fridge Moe, I got
	a date with my wife.
   <b>Moe:</b> You'll be back!  [<i>points at various customers</i>] And so will you.
	And you.  [<i>points at camera</i>] And you.
	 [<i>he points at Barney</i>]
<b>Barney:</b> Of course I'll be back.  If you didn't close, I'd never leave.

<em>Homer and Marge go on that bike ride, after all.  They sing along to
"Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head" as they bike into the sunset.
</em>
<em>[<i>End of Act Three.  Time: 21'11" {19'55"}</i>]
</em>
<em>Instead of the usual closing theme music, "Raindrops Keep Falling on
My Head" (as sung by Kipp Lennon) keeps playing.
</em>
      (instrumental continues for ~10 seconds)
     
     It won't be long before happiness steps up to greet me
       . . .
     Raindrops keep falling on my head
     But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
     Crying's not for me, 'cause
     I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
     Because I'm free, nothing's worrying me.

<em>The scene opens on the Stern Lecture Plumbing van ("I told you not to
flush that"), then focuses on the Simpsons' basement window.  A plumber
stands in a foot of water in front of a leaky pipe.
</em>
<b>Plumber: </b>Looks like you got a leak.
  <b>Marge: </b>Could you start fixing it pretty soon?  The basement is getting
         awfully flooded.  And I think the cat's down there.
          [<i>Snowball II meows balefully from underwater</i>]
<b>Plumber: </b>Yeah, I probably won't be able to get the parts I need for two,
         three weeks and that's if I order them today -- which I won't.
  <b>Marge: </b>Oh, dear.
          [<i>his pager beeps; he looks, it shows "Low Battery"</i>]
<b>Plumber: </b>Hmm, emergency call.  Gotta go.  [<i>starts to leave</i>]
  <b>Homer: </b>What should we do until you get back?
<b>Plumber: </b>Ehh, put a pan down there.
          [<i>Homer puts one down; it floats away</i>]
  <b>Homer: </b>Aw, it didn't work!

<em>On Homer's way to work, he gets stuck behind a huge lineup of cars on
the freeway.
</em>
<b>Homer: </b>Lousy traffic jams...[<i>laughs</i>] the traffic report will get me out
       of this one.
        [<i>turns on KBBL</i>]
<b>Arnie: </b>[<i>from a helicopter</i>] This is Arnie Pie!  Looks like we got a

       can see.

<em>Homer arrives at work quite late and pulls into the last available spot,
right on the end of a row.  From the other side of a fence, Bart waves
to him from his bedroom window: "Hi Dad!"  Homer makes dismissive noises
and walks towards the power plant entrance.  As he gets close, Lenny and
Carl pull up in their cars into parking spots right at the entrance.
"Hey," asks Homer suspiciously, "how come you guys got such great
parking places?"  Lenny answers quietly, "It's a secret."  Carl tells
him "Shh!  Shut up!"
</em>
<em>Homer walks to his station at work and sits on his chair, which promptly
collapses.  He looks at the bottom of the stool, which reads "Econo-save
budget stool: Factory Second".  "All right, Econo-save, you just made
the list!"  Homer says menacingly, pulling out "Homer's Revenge List"
and adding "Econo Save" to the end.
</em>
<em>He walks into the room where Carl and Lenny work and asks, "Hey!  Will
you guys help me fix my -- " but stops when he sees them sitting in big,
comfortable, vibrating chairs with their names on them.  "Hey...how come
you guys got better chairs than me."  Lenny answers him again, "It's a
secret!" and again Carl warns, "Shh!  Shut up!"
</em>
<em>At the soda machine, Lenny presses a ring with a special pattern onto it
into a special place on the machine and gets a soda without paying for
it.  Homer walks up, starts putting change in some change, and asks the
boys if they want to go bowling tonight.  "Naw, we're busy," replies
Lenny, and Carl adds, "Yeah, we got, er, things to do."  "Like what?"
asks Homer, slyly.  "Uh, it's a secret," says Lenny for the third time.
Carl, in the middle of drinking, stops and eyes Lenny, leaving Homer to
say, "Shut up!"
</em>
<em>At dinner, Homer tells the family about his day.
</em>
<b>Homer: </b>So anyway, Lenny and Carl are never around on Wednesdays and they
       don't tell me where they go.  It's like a conspiracy.
 <b>Bart: </b>A conspiracy, eh?  You think they might be involved in the
       Kennedy assassination in some way?
<b>Homer: </b>I do...now.  Anyway, I'm going to follow them tonight and see
       where they go.
<b>Marge: </b>Oh, Homer, don't start stalking people again.  It's so _illegal_.
       Remember when you were stalking Charles Kuralt because you
       thought he dug up your garden?
<b>Homer: </b>Well, something did!
<b>Marge: </b>I don't want you stalking anyone tonight.
<b>Homer: </b>Oh, OK, have it your own way, Marge.  I'll be back in a minute
       [<i>gets up</i>]: I'm...[<i>sly</i>] going outside.  To..._stalk_...Lenny and
       Carl.  [<i>realizes</i>] D'oh!
-- Homer has a garden?, "Homer the Great"

<em>Homer's head pops up from some bushes, then disappears again.  He
tiptoes up to Lenny's car, attaches a can of yellow paint to the trailer
hitch, pokes a hole in the bottom of it, then jumps out of sight just in
time as Lenny and Carl get in and drive off.  "Heh heh heh, all I have
to do is follow the yellow drip road," Homer chuckles.
</em>
<em>The pair stop in front of a strange-looking building.  Homer's mouth
opens wide in amazement.  Getting out, Lenny asserts, "There's our
secret meeting place."  Carl agrees, "Yes.  Let's go inside."  "Sounds
good," answers Lenny, and the two walk in.  A large man in a strange
robe guards the door menacingly.  Homer walks up innocently, humming,
and when the man blocks his entrance, he turns around quickly, still
humming.
</em>
<em>Inside, a large open hall is filled with men all wearing the same odd
robes.  Homer, not deterred, is sprawled over the glass-dome skylight.

  <b>Homer: </b>[<i>giggles</i>] I can see everything and they're none the wiser!
          [<i>the glass starts to crack, then it breaks and he falls in</i>]

<em>At work the next day, Homer confronts his two chums.
</em>
<b>Homer: </b>I saw weird stuff in that place last night.  Weird, strange,
       sick, twisted, eerie, godless, evil stuff!  And I want in.
 <b>Carl: </b>We don't, uh, know what you're talking about, Homer.
<b>Lenny: </b>And you can't join the Stonecutters because it's too exclusive!
 <b>Carl: </b>[<i>sighs</i>] Well, it was a real nice secret organization we had once.
-- And he'll tell two friends, and so on..., "Homer the Great"

<b>Homer: </b>Stonecutters, eh?  How do I join?
<b>Lenny: </b>There are only two ways to gain membership: be the son of a
       Stonecutter --
<b>Homer: </b>Next?
<b>Lenny: </b>-- or, save the life of a Stonecutter.
        [<i>starts to eat a sandwich</i>]
<b>Homer: </b>Hey!  [<i>grabs it, stomps on it</i>]
       I saved your life!  That egg sandwich could have killed you by
       cholesterol.
<b>Lenny: </b>Pfft, forget it, Homer.  While it has been established that eggs
       contain cholesterol, it has not yet been proven conclusively that
       they actually raise the level of serum cholesterol in the human
       blood stream.
<b>Homer: </b>So one of those Egg Council creeps got to you too, huh?
<b>Lenny: </b>Aw, you've got it all wrong, Homer.  It's not like that.

% he was suffering through yet another of Patty and Selma's slide shows.

Selma: [showing slides]  And this is Patty trying to plug her leg razor
into one of those ungodly Czechoslovakian outlets.
[next slide, of a hairy-legged Patty]  As you can see, we never
did get the hang of it.
Bart:  Aye, carumba!
-- ``Flaming Moe's''

% ``As I stared up at that hairy yellow drumstick, I knew I needed a drink.''
% Homer heads into the kitchen for a Duff, but since Selma took the last one,
% he has to improvise.

I decided to mix the little bits that were left in every liquor bottle.
In my haste, I had grabbed a bottle of the kid's cough syrup.
[mixes them in the blender, pours a glass, gulps it down]
[waves his hand in front of his face]
It passed the first test:  I didn't go blind.
-- Homer creates a new drink, ``Flaming Moe's''

% The slide show continues.  An ash from Selma's cigarette ignites Homer's
% drink.

I don't know the scientific explanation, but FIRE MADE IT GOOD.
-- Homer creates a new drink, ``Flaming Moe's''

% Moe invites Homer to make a `Flaming Homer'.  Homer needs cough syrup,
% and Moe goes through the lost-and-found.  He turns up some cough syrup.
% It's rather bland, but after you light it...

Wow, Homer, it's like there's a party in my mouth and everybody's invited!
-- Moe tastes a Flaming Homer, ``Flaming Moe's''

% A customer complains about the Love Tester (``I want my nickel back'') and
% Moe gives him a Flaming Homer.

Hey, this drink is delicious.  And my phlegm feels looser!
-- Snake oil not included, ``Flaming Moe's''

% The customer asks what it's called.  Homer explains, ``It's called
% a Flaming...''  Moe quickly interrupts, ``Moe.  It's called a Flaming
% Moe.  That's right, a Flaming Moe.  My name is Moe, and I invented it.
% That's why it's called a Flaming Moe.  What, what are you looking at
% Homer?  It's a Flaming Moe, I'm Moe.''
%
% [End of Act One.  Time: 7:00]
%
% Moe's Tavern is packed with customers, all drinking Flaming Moe's.

Barney: [discovers the salad bar]  Hey, what's this?
Moe:    A sneeze guard.
Barney: [sneezes, spewing snot all over the sneeze guard] Wow, it really works!
-- An ounce of prevention, ``Flaming Moe's''

Moe, I haven't seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down
on you for accepting food stamps.
-- Homer, ``Flaming Moe's''

% It's clear the it's the Flaming Moe that is drawing the customers.
% A pretty woman applies for the waitress position and gets it (after
% some lascivious comments from Moe and an insulting rejoinder).
% ``You shan't regret this.''  Harv Bannister from Tipsy McStagger's
% Good-Time Drinking and Eating Emporium offers to buy the recipe.
% (Moe doesn't quite understand that `Tipsy McStagger' is merely the
% name of the company; he thinks there really is a Mr. McStagger.)

The Flaming Moe is not for sale.  Do you know how much of my blood
and sweat are in this drink?
[everybody in the bar spits out their drink]
Uh, figure of speech.
-- Moe refuses to sell out, ``Flaming Moe's''

% Mr. Bannister surreptitiously pours a Flaming Moe into a container for
% future analysis.  Barney is pleased.  ``Good for you, Moe.  Only an
% idiot would give away a million-dollar idea like that!''  Homer is not
% pleased.  At school...

Martin: So the next time you use a gas chromatograph, remember to thank
Mr. A. J. P. Martin.
Ms. K:  [applauding]  Oh, brilliant, Martin, brilliant!  Once again, you've
wrecked the grading curve.  Oh, I pity the poor student who has

-- ``Inventors We Admire'' day, ``Flaming Moe's''

The Inventor I Admire, by Bart Simpson.
The inventor I admire is not a rich man or a famous man or even a smart
man.  He's my father, Homer Simpson.
-- ``Flaming Moe's''

% Bart proclaims that Homer invented the Flaming Homer, but everybody
% knows that Moe invented it.

Bart: My father invented that drink, and if you'll allow me to demonstrate...
[pulls out of brown paper bag a blender and bottles of liquor]
Ms.K: Bart, are those liquor bottles?
Bart: [as if this excused it] I brought enough for everybody.
Ms.K: Take those to the teachers' lounge!  You can have what's left at the
end of the day.
-- ``Inventors We Admire'' day, ``Flaming Moe's''

% Moe erects a neon `Flaming Moe's' sign atop his tavern, and Flaming Moe's
% becomes The Place To Be.  Krusty arrives with a date and punches out a

-- Serving one's country, ``Flaming Moe's''

% Moe makes the cover of magazines with his new drink.
% At the Simpsons dinner table, Lisa asks if, instead of milk, she can have
% a Virgin Moe, and Homer growls.  Bart arrives with a `I got toasted at
% Flaming Moe's' T-shirt.  Homer orders Bart to take it off, so he does.
% Bart eats dinner shirtless.  Marge suggests Homer talk to Moe.  Homer
% refuses.  Too upset to eat, he decides to go to Moe's.  (``D'oh!'')
% But he can't get past the bouncer.  Inside Moe introduces his new friends.

Moe:       How about a warm Flaming Moe's welcome for... Aerosmith!
Aerosmith: Nah, I don't think so Moe, we're just hanging out, etc.
Moe:       C'mon guys, free pickled eggs!
Aerosmith: Awright!  Yeah!  [head onstage]
-- The price of fame?  ``Flaming Moe's''

% They play `Walk This Way'.  Karl and Len enjoy their Flaming Moe's, but

% in the bathroom window and is surprised to see a well-dressed Barney.
% Barney introduces his friends Armondo and Ralphy.  Moe joins Aerosmith
% on stage.

Ms.K:  [heavy make-up, in a tube top]  Hiya, scrumptious.

Hugh.
Moe:  Uh, hold on, I'll check.  [calling]  Hugh Jass!  Somebody check the

Hugh: Uh, I'm Hugh Jass.
Moe:  Telephone.  [hands over the receiver]
Hugh: Hello, this is Hugh Jass.
Bart: [surprised]  Uh, hi.
Hugh: Who's this?
Bart: Bart Simpson.
Hugh: Well, what can I do for you, Bart?
Bart: Uh, look, I'll level with you, Mister.  This is a crank call that
sort of backfired, and I'd like to bail out right now.
Hugh: All right.  Better luck next time. [hangs up]  What a nice young man.
-- Nobody's perfect, ``Flaming Moe's''

% Moe explains to Homer that it's nothing personal. ``This is business.''

Hutz:  This all goes back to the Frank Wallbanger case of '78.
How about that!  I looked something up!

<em>But alas, it was all a dream.  Homer awakes to find himself at the power

<em>Back in the gallery, Bart narrates the second spooky story.
</em>
<b>Bart: </b>The next exhibit in out ghoulish gallery is entitled..."The School
      Bus"?  [<i>realizing</i>] Oh, they must mean "The Ghoooul Bus."
<b>Lisa: </b>[<i>reads the painting</i>] Nope, says right there: "School Bus".
<b>Bart: </b>[<i>with mock enthusiasm</i>] Well, there's nothing scarier than having
      to go to school.  Ha ha!  [<i>groans</i>]
-- Lame introductions, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

<em>The title, "Terror at 5 and a half feet" appears on the screen, and
behind it, the school bus.  On board, Bart sits next to Milhouse.
</em>
<b>Milhouse: </b>Hey Bart, look.  Krusty trading cards.  The long-awaited
          "Eight Series".
    <b>Bart: </b>[<i>reading the cards</i>] "Krusty visits relatives in Annapolis,
          Maryland.  Krusty poses for trading card photo."
<b>Milhouse: </b>Hmm...he seems to be running a little low on ideas.
    <b>Bart: </b>Well, at least you got the gum.
<b>Milhouse: </b>[<i>biting it</i>] Ow!  I cut my cheek.
-- Only $1.49 a pack, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

<em>Suddenly, a tire falls off the bus!  Otto tries in vain to control the
swerving vehicle, but he can't help veering into the path of an oncoming
transport truck.  Just before the inevitable crash, Bart wakes up
screaming.  Feeling his damp blankets, he says, "I hope this is sweat."
</em>
<em>He walks into the kitchen for breakfast.
</em>
<b>Lisa: </b>Bart, what's wrong?
<b>Bart: </b>[<i>in a monotone</i>] I just had a vision of my own horrible fiery
      death.
<b>Lisa: </b>[<i>expectantly</i>] And?
-- That's it?, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

<em>Marge realizes that Bart has had a nightmare, and she tries to reassure
him.  But an air-horn blast sounding suspiciously like that of the
transport truck makes Bart scream.  Homer walks in, proudly displaying
his air-horn and life jackets which he picked out of some guy's boat
down at the marina.  He blows the horn one more time, and Bart's nerves
are jarred.
</em>
<em>It's a rainy day as Bart and Lisa board the school bus.  Bart is
surprised to see Principal Skinner sitting on the bus.
</em>
Hello, Simpson.  I'm riding the bus today because Mother hid my car keys
to punish me for talking to a woman on the phone.  She was right to do
it.
-- Seymour "Norman" Skinner, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

<em>Lisa gets the attention of everyone on the bus.
</em>
  <b>Lisa: </b>Excuse me.  Bart's a little upset this morning, so could
        everyone please be extra-nice to him?

-- Small mercies, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

<em>Bart sits next to Milhouse, rubbing his throat dejectedly.  He glances
out the window and sees a gremlin clawing its way up the side of the
bus.  It sees him looking at it, and it grins, its claws digging furrows
in the side of the bus.  Bart grabs Milhouse.
</em>
    <b>Bart: </b>Milhouse...Milhouse, wake up, quick!  Look out the window.
<b>Milhouse: </b>No way, Bart.  If I lean over, I leave myself open to wedgies,
          wet willies, or even the dreaded rear-admiral!
-- Covering his ass, so to speak, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

<em>Bart pushes Milhouse out of the way and approaches Otto.  He implores
Otto to do something about the Gremlin on the side of the bus.  Otto
glances out and sees Hans driving an AMC Gremlin.  "No problemo, Bart-
dude, I'll get rid of him," he says, ramming Hans mercilessly.  Hans
begins to skid out of control, and he whines, "Oh no, I just made my
last payment."  He drives off the road and stops the vehicle just before
it hits a tree, but it explodes nonetheless.
</em>
<em>Bart's fears still aren't assuaged.  He looks out the window again, and
sees the gremlin on the back of the bus.  It pulls a metal cap off
something and begins removing spaghetti-strands of wire from under the
bus' side-paneling.  Bart yells, "Everybody, there's a monster on the
side of the bus!"  Everyone screams and runs over to look.
</em>
   <b>Jimbo: </b>Hey, there's no monster.
   <b>Ralph: </b>You're deceptive.
    <b>Otto: </b>I don't see anything.

<em>Bart stares worriedly out the window.  The gremlin jumps from under the
bus, and makes the finger-across-throat gesture at Bart.
</em>
<b>Skinner: </b>Now I've gotten word that a child is using his imagination...
         and I've come to put a stop to it!
   <b>Bart: </b>[<i>desperate</i>] No, no, it's true, there's a monster on the bus!
<b>Skinner: </b>The only monster on this bus is a lack of proper respect for
         the rules.
-- Seymour's adages, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

<em>The principal pulls the shade down over the window so Bart won't have to
worry about it any more.  Bart is still nervous, however, and he tries
to avoid peeking under the blind.  Eventually, he can resist no longer,
and he pulls it up.  He screams as Groundskeeper Willy's face appears at
the window.  It seems Willy, too, must ride the bus.
</em>

seventeen bullets in 'er!

<em>Bart is becoming desperate.

    <b>Bart: </b>[<i>with forced happiness</i>] You believe me, don't you?  You're my
          friend who believes me: sweet, trustworthy Milhouse.
<b>Milhouse: </b>Actually, Bart, you're kinda creeping me out.  Uh, I think I'm
          gonna go sit with that foreign exchange student.
           [<i>He does so</i>]
    <b>Uter: </b>Ah, guten tag!  Would you care for a bite of my
          Vengelerstrasse bar?  I also have a bag of marzipan Joy Joys.
-- Joy Joys Mit Iodine, even, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

<em>Bart hears a banging on the wheel hub under his feet.  He looks out the
window and the gremlin jumps out from under the bus.  It reaches towards
the lug-nuts that hold the wheel on.  Its claws make sparks against the
metal of the spinning tire, and it manages to remove one of the nuts.
After sniffing it disdainfully, it tosses it aside.
</em>
 <b>Bart: </b>The gremlin's taking off the wheel.  Stop the bus or we're all
       gonna die!
        [<i>Seymour grabs him in a headlock</i>]
<b>Willy: </b>Take me bridle and lash his hands to the seat.
-- A just punishment, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

<em>Skinner has decided to seat Uter next to Bart.  Uter offers Bart another
lick of his flavor wax, and Bart accepts the offer, cringing.  Bart
suggests that Uter loosen the ropes that bind him, and he gladly
complies: "Ja, das ist gut."
</em>
<em>Bart looks out the window again to see the gremlin continuing to remove
the nuts from the wheel.  He looks below his seat and sees a box of
flares, but the four flares have been removed.  Jimbo is the culprit
this time: he's lit them and put two of them in Martin's pants.  Bart
goes over and grabs one without Martin noticing, but he inadvertently
knocks the other one loose.  So he puts it back.
</em>
<em>He walks over to the window and pulls the "Emergency Release" lever, but
the pressure difference between the air inside and outside the bus tries
to suck Bart and everyone else out of the bus.  He manages to keep his
grip nonetheless.  He brandishes the flare, and the gremlin notices.
Just then, Homer drives by and blares his air-horn, greeting Bart with a
cheerful "Hey, boy."
</em>
<em>The gremlin, sensing its plans are about to be thwarted, tries to remove
the lug-nuts faster.  Skinner and Willy are trying to pull Bart's body
back inside the bus.
</em>
<b>Skinner: </b>Pull, Willy, pull!
  <b>Willy: </b>I'm doing all the pulling, you blouse-wearing poodle walker!
-- Fitting epithets, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

<em>The grown men succeed in pulling our hero back inside the bus.  As they
do so, Bart drops the lit flare and it bounces down the side of the bus.
Fortunately, it hits the gremlin and its body catches on fire.  It gapes
and loses its grip on the bus, falling off and bouncing down the road in
a little ball of flame.  Flanders happens to be driving behind it and it
smacks into his windshield.  Aghast, he skids to a halt and runs back to
its smoking body.
</em>
<em>"Oh dear Lord," he exclaims, looking at its inert form, "it's some sort
of hideous monster."  He wraps it up in his jacket and holds it to him.
An angry claw slashes out, and Ned smiles.  "Aw, isn't that cute.  He's
trying to claw my eyes out!"  He hugs it.
</em>
<em>The bus arrives safely at Springfield Elementary.  Everyone stands
outside the bus, staring at the tears in the metal made by the gremlin's
claws.  Skinner taps the lug-nut remaining in the back tire, and it
falls out, taking the wheel off with it.  "Gadzooks!"  Bart is being led
away on a stretcher, wearing a straight-jacket.
</em>
   <b>Bart: </b>Look at the bus.  I was right, I tell you, I was right!
<b>Skinner: </b>[<i>sternly</i>] Right or wrong, your behavior was still disruptive,
         young man!  Perhaps spending the remainder of your life in a
         madhouse will teach you some manners.
 <b>Nelson: </b>Ha, ha!
-- No punishment is too severe, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

<em>The orderly slams the door and heads off to the New Bedlam Mental
Hospital with the siren blaring.  Bart starts to relax: "At least now I
can get some rest."  But the gremlin appears at the back window and taps
on the glass.  It lifts Flanders' decapitated head up by the hair and
the head intones, "Heidily-ho, Bart!"  Bart screams.

<b>Smithers: </b>Simpson family, master.
   <b>Burns: </b>Simpson, eh?  Excellent.
-- The running gag continueth, "Treehouse of Horror IV"

<em>Lisa, the perceptive one, has noticed Mr. Burns' shadow seems to act

</em>
 <b>Lisa: </b>[<i>sotto voce</i>] Dad, do you notice anything strange?
<b>Homer: </b>[<i>sotto voce</i>] Yeah, his hairdo looks so queer --

<em>Lisa is becoming more certain something's terribly wrong.  She
"accidentally" spills blood on herself, then claiming she and Bart have
to go wash up.  When Bart begins to protest, she smears blood on his
face and drags him along.
</em>
<em>Bart is not convinced that Mr. Burns is a vampire.  "And even if he was,
we're not going to stumble on his secret hiding place."  But as he says
this, he presses down on a stone-arm torch holder.  A wall slides back,
revealing the secret location of the washer and dryer.
</em>
<em>Lisa sees reason.  "You're probably right.  Let's just go back to...
(gasp)" In ghostly red neon lettering, she sees "TO SECRET VAMPIRE ROOM"

</em>
<em>Bart and Lisa walk down the stairs into a room full of coffins.
</em>

<b>Bart: </b>Big deal.  It's no different from the basement in Grandpa's rest

<em>Lisa notices a tome resting on a stand, and she runs over to read the
title: "Yes, I Am a Vampire, by Monty Burns.  Foreword by Steve Allen."

tries to get Lisa's attention.
</em>
<b>Bart: </b>[<i>strangled</i>] Shee, ba-ba-ba-ba --

-- Bart tries to warn Lisa of the walking undead, "Treehouse of Horror
    IV"

<em>A greenish hand rakes its claws along the page of the book she's
reading, and she screams in fright.  The two children run frantically up
the spiral staircase.  On the way up, Bart notices a "SUPER FUN HAPPY
SLIDE" lever protruding from the wall, and he pulls it, figuring he
won't be back any time soon.  The stairs change to a slippery stone
ramp, and Bart begins his descent.  At first, he shouts "Whee!", but as
he nears the bottom, his joy turns to fear as the arms of the undead
reach for him.
</em>
<em>He is grabbed by an undead woman in a purple dress.  Before she can do
anything, a bat flies into the room.  It turns into Mr. Burns, who grins
evilly at Bart.  "Well, if it isn't little...uh, boy!" he cackles with
glee.
</em>
<em>Lisa runs back into the dining room.
</em>
 <b>Lisa: </b>[<i>breathlessly</i>] Mom, Dad: Mr. Burns is a vampire, and he has Bart!

that Bart is floating mysteriously outside.  She yells.

</em>
<em>As they get to the bottom of the stairs, Lisa hands Homer a wooden stake
and mallet, and tells him, "You must drive this stake right through his
heart."  Homer looks over at Burns' coffin apprehensively.  He
approaches it and tears the lid off to reveal a sleeping Monty Burns.
"Take that, vile fiend!" he cries, hammering the stake into the still
body.  "Uh, Dad?  That's his crotch," observes Lisa.
</em>
<em>Homer removes the stake sheepishly, and drives it into the old man's
heart.  Burns awakes suddenly, but it's too late: he gasps and groans as
his body melts into a puddle of flesh.  Homer sighs with relief, but
Burns has a little life left still: "You're fired!" he yells, quickly
melting again.

 <b>Apu: </b>Yes indeed I do think that.  But, I learned long ago Lisa to
      tolerate others rather than forcing my beliefs on them.  You know
      you can influence people without badgering them always.  It's like

Maybe I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I love you
You pulled me out of time
You hung me on the line
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you
...
Maybe I'm a man, maybe I'm a lonely man
Who's in the middle of something

That he doesn't really understand

Maybe I'm a man, and baby, you're the only woman
Who could ever help me

Baby, won't you help me to understand?

for Ned's birthday (Little Ned opens a birthday present), a summer
shirt and shorts during the Summer, and finally back into his coat.

<em> We begin with a computer-generated sequence, depicting two football
</em><em> players approaching each other.  The red-uniformed player (#86) sticks
</em><em> out his arm, decapitating the blue-uniformed player (#12), whose head
</em><em> flies off (with a shocked expression), sailing through the logo, ``Inside
</em><em> Football Today.''  Brent Gunsilman welcomes the home audience to ``six
</em><em> hours of exciting football action.''  Homer, surrounded by his favorite
</em><em> salt- and cholesterol-laden treats, announces ``Bye-bye belt!'', whips
</em><em> off his belt, and lets it all hang out.  He then digs in ferociously.
</em><em> Marge sees him and warns him that those foods aren't good for his heart.
</em><em> Homer scoffs, ``My heart is just fine.''  We take an inside look at Homer's
</em><em> chest cavity, where an aorta blows up like a balloon (presumably due to a
</em><em> clogged artery), but the danger is averted when the clog clears, and
</em><em> the blood continues on its way.  (``A little beer will put out &lt;that&gt;
</em><em> fire,'' says Homer.)

   And now, with his picks for today's games, the man who's right 52% of
   the time, Smooth Jimmy Apollo!

<em> Jimmy says the Denver/New England game is too close to call.  ``But

   Lisa:  No. ... Well, we used to have burping contests, but I outgrew it.
   -- ``Lisa the Greek''
   
   Well, if you want to get closer to him, then maybe &lt;you&gt; should bridge the
   gap.  I do it all the time.  I pretend I'm interested in looking at power
   tools, going to those silly car-chase movies, and ... some things I'll tell
   you about when you're older.
   -- Marge's advice to Lisa, ``Lisa the Greek''
   
<em> Bart slips a dish into the bathwater and receives a brief scolding.
</em><em>
</em><em> In the third quarter, New England is winning, 35 to 7.  Lisa suggests
</em><em> that she watch the game with Homer, and he reluctantly agrees.  ``Just
</em><em> don't say anything and sit down over there.''  Lisa plops on the couch,
</em><em> and Homer tells her to keep moving over until she's at the far end of
</em><em> the sofa.  Lisa sighs.  Homer scolds, ``Lisa, please, I can't hear the
</em><em> announcer.''  ``He said Denver just fumbled.''  ``D'oh!''
</em><em>
</em><em> In the yard, Bart uses a magnifying glass to melt a plastic soldier toy.
</em><em> (``See you in hell, soldier boy!'')  Marge suggests that, since Homer and
</em><em> Lisa are inside watching the game, it ``might be fun'' for Bart to go
</em><em> shopping for clothes with her.  Bart maintains that he doesn't need new
</em><em> clothes, though his point is undermined by the holes in the shirt and pants
</em><em> he's currently wearing.
</em><em>
</em><em> Back to `Inside Football Today', where New England has defeated Denver
</em><em> by a score of 55 to 10.

          Well, folks, when you're right 52% of the time, you're wrong 48%

<em> There, she loads up Bart with brightly-patterned clothes.
</em>

<em> Bart's arms are loaded with clothes, the pile reaching above his head.
</em><em> Marge scolds, ``And don't make that face at me.''  Bart responds, ``How'd

</em><em>
</em><em> The Dolphins score a touchdown, and Homer celebrates (spilling his Duff
</em><em> in the process).  Lisa copies Homer's cheering.  Homer lets slip that

<em> Lisa concludes that ``gambling makes a good thing even better.''
</em><em> Homer realizes that there is some kind of bond between him and his daughter.
</em><em>
</em><em> Bart changes in the fitting room and sees the sign ``This room monitored
</em><em> at all times.''  He spots a TV camera, so he takes some cardboard backing
</em><em> and makes the sign, ``Get bent.''  The security men

</em><em> aren't the socks she came in with!''  Armed with high-powered rifles, they
</em><em> head out.

</em><em> Marge checks up on Bart, who at the moment is dressed only in his briefs.
</em><em> Everybody in the store chuckles at Bart's embarrassing situation.

</em><em> Homer and Lisa celebrate Miami's 24-10 victory over Cincinnati.
</em><em> Homer then tells Lisa not to breathe a word about Homer's gambling to
</em><em> Marge.

you'll have to let the other dogs go too."  Burns sees through this one:

   Hey, Mr. President!  I campaigned for the other guy, but I voted for you!
   -- Krusty, ``I Love Lisa''
   
<em> Krusty tells a lame joke, and even though the `Applause' sign
</em><em> flashes, the audience remains silent.  Krusty quickly introduces a
</em><em> clip of Robert Frost in 1963 reading one of his poems.  Krusty makes
</em><em> faces at the camera, then asks, ``Hey, Frostie!  Want some snow,
</em><em> man?''  He pulls a rope, which dumps a huge load of synthetic snow
</em><em> on the poet.  Frost continues his poem.  The President laughs

</em><em>
</em><em> Next clip is from 1973, ``Kroon Along With Krusty''.  A

</em><em> Ralph asks Lisa if she'd like a bite of his ice cream.  Lisa

<em> It's the dreaded ``Talk with the audience'' part.  As Krusty wanders
</em><em> the audience in search of a victim, Lisa quietly pleads, ``Oh no,

Yeah... well, I may not have a fancy black bathrobe and a hammer like
Snooty, but I do have slippers and an oatmeal spoon. Look!
-- Abe vs. Judge Muntz, "The Curse of the Flying Hellfish"

<em>Mrs. Krabappel invites Abe to come up front and "give someone else a
chance to interrupt" over Bart's protests.  "About time, knothead,"
Abe grumbles.
</em>
<em>The storyteller comes in front of the class, and urges everybody to
shut up.
</em>
   <b>Abe:</b> Now, my story begins in 19-dickety-two. We had to say "dickety"
        'cause that Kaiser had stolen our word "twenty". I chased that
        rascal to get it back, but gave up after dickety-six miles...
         [<i>children laughing</i>]
<b>Martin:</b> "Dickety"? Highly dubious!

   <b>Abe:</b> Stop your snickerin'! I spent three years on that terlet!
-- Well, duh, "The Curse of the Flying Hellfish"

<em>But it's no use; he's just making a fool of himself and Bart. At

</em>
 <b>Bart:</b> And then, he claimed he was the one who turned cats and dogs

<b>Homer:</b> Maybe it's time we put Grampa in a home.
 <b>Lisa:</b> You already put him in a home.
 <b>Bart:</b> Maybe it's time we put him in one where he can't get out.

<em>But at Springfield's Retirement Castle, life doesn't always hold that
much excitement, as Abe has nothing else to do but read his mail,
which is nothing else than a bunch of flyers.

Eh, this junk was hardly worth getting up for. Maybe if I go back to

-- "The Curse of the Flying Hellfish"

<em>As Abe ponders this option, he notices an envelope. The letter is
from the Fighting Hellfish, and says only one thing: "Asa Phelps has
died."  This comes as shocking news to Abe: "The 7th Hellfish is
dead?! That means the fortune's almost mine..."
</em>
<em>At Asa's funeral ceremony, Abe is the only one present, until
Montgomery Burns shows up. During Reverend Lovejoy's lecture, he
pulls a string from his coat, revealing a key tied at the end. Abe
nods, and pulls a long string from his own coat; after a while, he
reaches the very end, where a similar key is tied. Burns nods in
agreement.
</em>
Asa Phelps spent his entire life in Springfield, except for four years'
service in WWII and one high school day-trip. He worked at the United
Strut and Bracing Works as a molder's boy, until he was replaced by a
Molder-Matic, and died.
-- Eulogy of Asa Phelps as spoken by Reverend Timothy Lovejoy,
      "The Curse of the Flying Hellfish"

<em>After Lovejoy drives away, Abe and Burns walk to a monument bearing a
statue of the Hellfish. On the front is a door with nine keyholes, of
which seven already have a key inserted in. Without a word, Abe and
Burns insert their own key and unlock the door, which holds a metal
box. "Would you do the honors?" asks Burns. Abe thus opens the box
and takes out a piece of paper, on which nine names are written.
After he has crossed out Asa Phelps, only his name and Burns' remain.
</em>
<b>Burns:</b> There, Simpson: seven gone. As soon as you're in your pressboard
       coffin, I'll be the sole survivor and the treasure will be mine.

       yourself?

<em>Smithers wonders if assassinating Abe is really necessary due to his

<em>At his mansion, Vidal answers the phone.

<em>Flashback to 1944, at the Ardennes.

Back then, I was known as Sgt. Simpson, and I commanded the Flying
Hellfish, the fightingest squad in the fightingest company in the
third-fightingest battalion in the army.
-- Abe starts his story, "The Curse of the Flying Hellfish"

<em>Abe introduces Bart via flashback to the Flying Hellfish; Iggy Wiggum
who left a grenade without a pin in a knapsack; Sheldon Skinner,
with a "Shoot me" sign on the back; Private Fifth Class Arnie Gumble
who burps in a tank; and Griff, Asa, Ox, and Etch. But every unit has
a troublemaker; in the case of the Hellfish, it was a cocky little
private named Montgomery Burns.
</em>
<em>In this flashback, Burns is carried unconscious on a litter, until he
wakes up.
</em>
Duh, hey! You said you was dead!
-- Ox carries Burns out on a litter, "The Curse of the Flying Hellfish"

<b>Bart:</b> Mm-hmm. You bossed around the richest, most powerful guy in town.

      "The Curse of the Flying Hellfish"

<em>Of course, something stood in the way: a tennis ball, to be precise,
thrown by nobody else than Monty Burns. "Little help?" he asks,
holding a racket. Soon he has other things to care about, as Germans
start shooting at the squad. One grenade lands right next to Burns,
and Simpson saves the day by sitting on it with his helmet.

Boom! Boom, it went! Boom! Just like that! They took a photo of my
keister for Stars and Stripes. At least they told me it was for Stars
and Stripes.
-- Abraham J. Simpson, "The Curse of the Flying Hellfish"

<em>Back to the closing days of the war, as the Hellfish had just flushed
some Germans out of an abandoned castle, Burns holds a painting, and
carts it away.  Sgt. Simpson threatens to report Burns to Commander
Flanders.
</em>
   <b>Sgt.:</b> Just leave [<i>the paintings</i>], Burnsie.
  <b>Burns:</b> Leave them for whom, the Germans, the folks who shoot at us all
         day? Let's just take them. We'll all be rich, rich as Nazis.
-- Wow, Nazis, "The Curse of the Flying Hellfish"
   
   <b>Etch:</b> Think of what a guy could get himself with that kind of

<b>Skinner:</b> Yeah, I could buy chicken dinners three times a day!
 <b>Wiggum:</b> I could buy a brand-new studebaker, one with a fan on the
         dashboard!
 <b>Gumble:</b> I could pay my way into high- [<i>belches</i>] society!
   <b>Sgt.:</b> Well, I don't feel right about it, but I could use a nest egg
         for retirement. I'd hate to wind up in one of them old folks

-- WWII paintings are found, "The Curse of the Flying Hellfish"

<b>Burns:</b> Then it's agreed. Of course, we can't sell the paintings now,
       we'd be caught. How many of you are familiar with the concept of
       a "tontine"?
        [<i>all stare at him, until Ox raises his hand</i>]
<b>Burns:</b> All right, Ox. Why don't you take us through it?
   <b>Ox:</b> Duh, essentially, we all enter into a contract whereby the last
       surviving participant becomes the sole possessor of all them
       purty pictures.
<b>Burns:</b> Well put, Oxford.
-- His name comes with a dual meaning,
    "The Curse of the Flying Hellfish"

<em>"Now remember, you can't _all_ sign with an X."
</em>
 <b>Abe:</b> So, we sealed up the paintings knowing only one of us would ever
      look upon them again. Ox was the first to go; he got a hernia
      carrying the crate out of the castle. Five more men died in the
      Veteran's Day float disaster of '79. Now, with Asa gone, it's down
      to me and Burns.
<b>Bart:</b> Great story Grampa, could've used a vampire though. 'Night.

-- Even though they crashed on my property,

       [<i>long pause</i>]
 <b>Abe:</b> Hey, you got the keys!
-- Delayed reaction, "The Curse of the Flying Hellfish"

<b>Bart:</b> Now we can get the treasure!
 <b>Abe:</b> Oh, what's the use. Burns would still find some way to take it
      from me.
<b>Bart:</b> I can't believe you, Grampa. The sergeant in that story you told
      would never be scared of a dork like Burns. You gotta get that

<b>Bart:</b> 64 times, no more, no less. Got it.

<b>Bart:</b> Hey, Grampa, do you thing I could've been a Flying Hellfish?
 <b>Abe:</b> You're a gutsy daredevil with a give-em-hell attitude and a
      fourth-grade education. You could've made sergeant.

<em>They bring the crate on board, and it is indeed filled with valuable

-- "The Curse of the Flying Hellfish"

<em>But Abe won't allow Burns to just get away with it. He takes the
grapple and fires at Burns' boat, then uses the grapple as a rod for
water-skiing. Burns finds his acrobatics quite humorous, but changes
his mind when Abe manages to climb the rope up to his boat and jumps
over him. The two of them are still fighting when the boat hits the
shore, propelling them on the beach.
</em>
<b>Burns:</b> Don't kill me...
  <b>Abe:</b> I ain't gonna kill ya, that'd be cowardly; Monty Burns cowardly.

<em>Bart's first hurdle is a barrier which he successfully hops; Shelby

goes off.  A ferocious dog runs after Bart, growling.  Homer assures
Bart he'll take care of it, throwing the dog a steak.  It leaps in the
air, catches it, and continues after Bart.  "Faster, son!  He's got a
taste for meat now!"  Bart jumps into the RV just in time as the dog's

</em><em> A new headline:  ``I married Bigfoot.''  Marge is surrounded by reporters.
</em><em> ``His name isn't Bigfoot.  His name is Homer.''  Another headline:
</em><em> ``Bigfoot's wife pleads:  `Call him Homer!' ''.  ``What does it eat?'' asks

   -- Bart, ``Call of the Simpsons''

<em> Homer breaks free and runs off.  They shoot him with a tranquilizer dart.

<em> On television, the reporter explains that scientists from around the world

</em>
   Dr. Marvin Monroe:  After extensive biological and anatomical testing,
       I regret to announce that our findings are... inconclusive.
       This thing may or may not be human.
   German scientist: Dat's what he tinks.  I say it's none other than Bigfoot
        himself.
   French scientist: Oh, no, I disagree.  I think it is a man.

==============================================================================
The disclaimer for this year's Halloween special is brought to us by Homer,
imitating the distinctive outline of Alfred Hitchcock.

Homer: Good Eeevening.  I've been asked to tell you that the following show
is very scary, with stuff that might give your kids nightmares.  You
see, there are some *crybabies* out there, religious types mostly,
who might be offended.  If you are one of them, I advise you to turn
off your set now.

Homer dares us by flapping his arms and clucking like a chicken.
Someone from the television audience takes up Homer's dare. As we
all stare at a dot, Marge's footsteps enter from off-stage.

Marge: Homer, did you just call everyone ``chicken''?
Homer: Noooo.  I swear on this Bible!
Marge: That's not a Bible; that's a book of carpet samples!
Homer: Ooooh... Fuzzy.

[End of Disclaimer.  Duration: 0'41"]

The Simpson family host a Halloween costume party for Bart and Lisa's
friends.  Homer descends the stairs, dressed in a toga.

Homer: Behold mighty Caesar! [sheet catches on a nail]  In all his glory!
[kids laugh at the Emperor's new clothes]  D'oh!

Nelson (dressed as a pirate) watches Martin dance gayly towards him.

Martin: I am Calliope, the muse of heroic poetry!
Nelson: No kiddin'!  [kidney-punches Martin]

Bart ``Alec'' Simpson admits...

Bart:  [English accent] Stupid party, wish we were trick or treat'n.
Marge: Now Bart, you can find just as much horror around the house.

Marge sits in the middle of the front room with a flashlight.  Lisa turns
off the lights.  Marge begins with a scary story about a witch who died a
horrible death.  She passes food around to the children that represents
parts of the witch's body.

Bart:  Yo, Mom!  We haven't got the eyeballs yet.
Marge: [aims the flashlight at Homer, who is eating the ghoulish snacks]
Homer, you're ruining it!
Homer: Yeah, well... It was an evil game.

Marge asks if anyone knows a ghost story.  Lisa steps forward, with a tale
about a boy and his doll.

Homer: That's not so scary.
Lisa:  A doll...  From *Hell*!
Homer: [cowardly] I'm gonna go to the store...
Lisa:  [laughs evilly]

== CLOWN WITHOUT PITY ==

Bart thanks Grampa Simpson for giving him more money than you would believe
for his birthday.  Marge wonders where Abe got the money from.

Abe:   The Government.  I didn't earn it; I don't need it; but if they miss
one payment, I'll raise HELL!

Bart:  Hey Homer, where's your present?
Homer: D'oh!  I mean...  D`oh-n't worry son, I forgot to get you a present.
But I swear on my father's grave--
Abe:   Hey!

Homer rushes off to the nearest convenient `House of Evil' (your one-
stop Evil shop).  He asks the very old Asian owner who appears out of
the shadows if he sells toys.

Owner: We sell forbidden objects from places men fear to tread.
We also sell frozen yogurt, which I call ``Frogurt''!

Homer tells the owner that he is looking for a present for his son's
birthday.  The owner hands to him a talking Krusty doll.

Owner: Take this object, but beware it carries a terrible curse!
Homer: [worried] Ooooh, that's bad.
Owner: But it comes with a free Frogurt!
Homer: [relieved] That's good.
Owner: The Frogurt is also cursed.
Homer: [worried] That's bad.
Owner: But you get your choice of topping!
Homer: [relieved] That's good.
Owner: The toppings contains Potassium Benzoate.
Homer: [stares]
Owner: That's bad.

Bart and his friends use the front door to play `Pin the Tail on the Donkey'.
During Milhouse's turn Homer bursts in, crushing the poor kid into the wall.

Homer hands his delicately wrapped birthday present over to Bart, who
immediately renders the packaging to shreds.  After testing the doll (``I'm
Krusty the Klown, and I love you very much.'')  Bart gives his father a hug
and thanks him for the best birthday he's ever had.  Abe has a different
opinion.

Abe:   [shouting] That doll is *Evil*, I tells ya.  Evil!  Eeeeeeviillll!!!
Marge: Grandpa, you said that about all the presents.
Abe:   [whines] I just want attention.

Sitting on the couch with a large bowl of popcorn, Homer watches a Kent
Brockman newscast.

Kent:  ...and in environmental news, scientists have announced that
Springfield's air is now only dangerous to children and the elderly.

As Homer leans back, we see the Krusty doll is now sitting next to him.
Homer plays with the toy.

Doll:  I'm Krusty the Klown and I don't like you.
Homer: Heh heh heh heh.
Doll:  I'm Krusty the Klown and I'm going to *kill* you!
Homer: Hee hee hee.  Didn't even pull the string that time.
Doll:  I said I was going to kill you! [points finger] YOU!  Homer Simpson!

Homer dismisses the doll over the side of the couch, but the doll reappears
brandishing a large butchers knife.  Homer screams as the doll flies
through the air on the attack. The rest of the family rush in from the
kitchen. Homer cowers at the opposite end of the couch from the doll.

Marge: Homer, what's wrong?
Homer: [pointing to the harmless doll]
That doll tried to kill me!
Bart:  I'd say the pressure has finally gotten to Dad, but what pressure?

Homer's pleas go unheeded as his family leave him to be alone with the doll.
The doll approaches, laughing sinisterly until the pull-string ends. At the
doll's request, Homer pulls the string and the the doll continues its
sinister laugh.  Homer takes a bath.

Homer: [singing] My baloney has a first name, it's H-O-M-E-R.  My baloney
has a second name, it's H-O-M-E-R...

The doll emerges out of the bath water, welding a miniature harpoon.
Homer screams and runs nude through the house, past Marge and her two
sisters in the kitchen.

Patty:  There goes the last lingering thread of my heterosexuality.

In Lisa's bedroom, Krusty chats up her Malibu Stacey doll.

Krusty Doll: Hey baby!  Get comfortable.  Relaaax.  It's a little hot for
that cheerleader outfit, don't you think?

Homer enters with a bag, rope, chains and a suitcase.  He grabs the doll,
drops it in a bag of dirty socks, then secures it in the suitcase.

Krusty Doll: You think your dirty socks can stop me?!
Well, they *are* making me... dizzy.  Ooooohhh..

After locking the suitcase, Homer drops it down the Bottomless Pit (``Good
byeeeee Dolly.'')  A gangster bids arrivederci to a body bag and throws it
down the hole.  Another man walks up to the edge of the pit and drops in a
large box.

Man: I was a fool to think that anyone would want nude photos of Whoopi
Goldberg. [pit rejects the photos]  What the--?

Homer returns home and parks his car in the garage, unaware of the tiny
passenger strapped to the car's underside. Two tiny hands cover Homer's
eyes as he enters the house.

Doll:  Guess who, Fat boy!!
Homer: [blinded, bumping around, with the doll strapped to his head]
Marge!  Marge!  Look!
Marge: [from the kitchen] Oh, my God!
Homer: [staggering into the kitchen] The doll's trying to kill me and the
toaster's been laughin' at me!

Homer and the Killer Doll roll about the floor and Homer has his face dunked
in the dog dish (``Eeeew! Dog water!'')  Marge calls the number on the
Krusty doll box (1-900-DON'T-SUE).

Marge: Your doll is trying to kill my husband!  [pause] Yes, I'll hold.

Marge lets the Krusty Co. repairman into the kitchen, to see Homer on the
floor, the doll yanking at his tongue.  Picking up the doll, the repairman
identifies the problem.

Repairman: [pointing to a Good/Evil switch on the back of the doll]
Yup, here's your problem.  Someone set this thing to ``Evil''.

Problem solved.  The repairman places the doll on Homer's chest, leaving it
to confess its love for Homer.  Homer hugs the doll (``Come here, you.'')

And soon the doll becomes a slave to Homer's every desire.  Homer blankly
watches TV as Krusty places a tray of food on the coffee table.

Doll:  Here you go, buddy.
Homer: Did you walk the dog?
Doll:  Yeah, he buried me a couple of times.
Homer: Yeah, dogs like to bury old junk.
Doll:  [grumbles, sotto voce] Yeah, you stupid idiot.

At the end of the day, Krusty retires to be with Malibu Stacey in Lisa's
doll house.

Doll: Oooh, what a day.  Homer made me give him a sponge bath [shudders]
But coming home to you makes it all worthwhile.

Stacey's head falls off when Krusty kisses her, but he immediately returns
it to her shoulders.  With an arm around his partner, the doll is content.
A heart shape frames the scene.

[End of Act One.  OzTiming: 6'14"]

Shining a flashlight in his face, Homer bores everybody with his own lame
attempt at story telling.

Homer: ...and his _wife_ comes through the door!
Bart:  [bored] So?
Homer: Did I mention that she was dead?
Lisa:  No.
Homer: Well, she was.  Aaaand she hit him in the head with a *golf-club*!
Bart:  And?
Homer: Don't you remember?  He went golfing all the time and it really
bugged her.
Lisa:  You said he went bowling!

Abe:   Homer!  I've coughed up scarier stuff than that!

Bart:  Grandpa, why don't you tell us a story? You've led an interesting life.
Abe:   [resentfully] That's a lie and you know it!  But I have seen a *lot*
of movies...

== KING HOMER ==

It was a dark and foggy evening.  Mr. Burns and Smithers are standing on a
wharf as if they're expecting someone else.  Marge approaches.

Marge: My name is Marge Bouvier.  I'm here about your ad [in the newspaper
she is holding]: ``Single white female wanted for mysterious
expedition.  Must like monkeys.  Non-smoker preferred.''
Burns: Well, you'd be a welcome change of pace from the rest of these crude
and uncouth sailors.

On the dock, two of the crude and uncouth sailors (``Aarrr!'') attempt to
stare each other down.  Mr. Burns turns to Smithers.

Burns:    What do you think, Smithers?
Smithers: I think women and sea-men don't mix.
Burns:    We *know* what you think!

Mr. Burns hires the young lady and lets out a sinister laugh.  All at sea,
Marge sunbathes while Karl, Lenny and Charlie admire the view from the
ship's smokestack.

Karl:    Hey, I heard we're goin' to Ape Island.
Lenny:   Yeah, to capture a giant ape.
Karl:    I wished we were going to Candy Apple Island.
Charlie: Candy Apple Island?  What do they got there?
Karl:    Apes.  But they're not so big.

Anchored off the shore of Ape Island, Captain Otto hears the natives
chanting ``HO-MER! HO-MER! HO-MER!''.  He asks Mr. Burns about it.

Otto:  Hey, who's this ``Homer'' dude?
Burns: He's either a 50-foot prehistoric ape, or a tourist trap concocted
by the Ape Island Jaycees.  Either way, we're going ashore.
Marge: [walks into scene] Am I going too?
Burns: Of course.  We wouldn't think of going without the bait-- uhh, that
is, the bait-thing beauty.  The bathing beauty!
[to himself] Heh heh.  I covered that up pretty well.

Standing before an awesome wooden gateway, the Island Chief notices Marge,
Burns, and Smithers hiding in the grass while the other natives continue
chanting.

Chief: Mosi Tatupu!  Mosi Tatupu!
(translation: The Blue-haired woman will make a good sacrifice.)
Marge: What's he saying?
Burns: He's saying ``We wouldn't *dream* of sacrificing the blue-haired woman.''

Her kind comments are interrupted when the natives grab her, clothe her in
their traditional sacrificial garments (i.e: skimpy clothing) and tie her
between two pillars on the wrong side of the gates.

Marge: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

A giant gong distracts King Homer as he battles with a Tyrannosaurus Rex,
allowing the reptile to get in the last bite (``D'ohhdohhdohhdohh'' echoes
throughout the island); he then goes to investigate.  Marge screams some
more when a giant face leers down at her from the treetops.  Nearby, Mr.
Burns explains to Smithers the importance of the moment.

Burns: Smithers, this is a golden opportunity!  If we can get him alive, we
can put him on Broadway!  Dead, we'll sell monkey stew to the Army!

King Homer enjoys playing and smelling Marge's hair (much to her liking).
Mr. Burns instructs his armed men in how to bring down a giant Homer.

King Homer only feels a stinging sensation from the rifle bullets, and is
only mildly distracted when Lenny fires a ship cannon.  Placing Marge in a
tree, the ape places Lenny in his mouth.

Lenny: Hey Homer, cut it out!  Come on!  Quit eatin' me!

Karl fires his rifle, hitting Lenny in the arm.

Lenny: Ow! [sarcastically] Nice shot, Karl!

King Homer burps after swallowing Lenny.  Mr. Burns uncrates the sleeping-
gas grenades.

Burns: All right, you big ape...  Get a snootful of this gas bomb!

He feebly throws the bomb a foot and gets a snootful himself (``I was
strolling through the Gas one day...'')  Smithers succeeds with the
second attempt.

Burns: Nice work, Smithers!  When we get back, I'm giving you a raise!
[King Homer swallows Smithers whole, pause]  Oh well...

Homer is chained and shackled, and brought to Broadway with the `Chubbiest
Kickline in Town'.  After dancing girls kick their way off stage, one of
the many reporters asks Mr. Burns a question.

Reporter: What kind of show you got for us, Mr. Burns?
Burns:    Well, the Ape's going to stand around for three hours or so.
Then we'll close with the ethnic comedy of Duggan and Dirschwitz.
Reporter: Sen-sational!

Mr. Burns walks out before the audience.

Burns: Ladies and gentlemen!  In his native land he was a King!  But he
comes before you in chains for your own amusement!  Presenting Homer!
The Eighth Wonder of the World!

The curtains draw back, presenting a terrified Homer.  Barney (rudely)
points his finger at the King, amazed at the size of Homer's platform.
Reporters start taking photographs.  Marge senses the camera flashes are
unsettling the giant beast.

Marge:    I think you're making him angry...
Reporter: [derisively] C'mon, what's he gonna do?  Run amok in downtown
Springfield?

Famous last words -- Homer starts to break free of his bonds, pausing to
scratch himself, then squashes the screaming reporter.  The hysterical
crowd flee except for Barney, who courageously offers Homer a peanut.
He kicks the greedy ape for taking the whole bag.

King Homer crashes through the wall into an adjoining theatre, where Shirley
Temple is performing.  Homer is briefly charmed by Shirley's singing and tap
dancing before he swallows her whole (crunch crunch).

In a hotel suite, Mr. Burns is deeply shaken by the recent events.
He sits with Marge on a bed.

Burns: I'm dreading the reviews, I can tell you that.

A giant angry eye peeks through a window, and Marge cheerfully waves back.
Reaching into the room and taking a screaming Marge in his hand, Homer
starts to climb the building.  Planes circle overhead.

Marge notices Homer is having difficulty climbing the building.

Marge: Y'know, you look a little flushed.  Maybe you should eat more
vegetables and less people...

Exhausted, Homer places Marge on a ledge and falls a few feet to the
pavement.  A crowd gathers as Burns and Marge approach the body.

Marge: [feeling for Homer's breath with her hand] He's not dead!
Burns: No, but his career is.  I remember when Al Jolson ran amok at the
Winter Garden and climbed the Chrysler building.
Homer: [moans]
Marge: Don't worry, Homey.  I'll take care of you.

A newspaper spins into view; the headline reads: `WOMAN WEDS APE'.
At church, the family and friends of the bride and groom watch as Beauty
and the Beast exchange vows.  Afterwards, they have their picture taken.

Photographer: [to King Homer's relatives]
Folks, if you could just stop cleaning each other for a second..

Mrs. Bouvier: [worried] Wait, Marge, I can't find your father!
Marge:  [sees a leg disappear into King Homer's mouth] Oh Homer...

[End of Act Two.  OzTiming: 12'52"]

Instead of candies, Marge brings out a bowl of fresh fruits (``..is Nature's
Candy'') for the kids.  An ungrateful child throws an ashtray at her.
Before she can recover, a man with his head resting on his chest and blood
spurting from the neck stump jumps through the front door.

Man:  Awwwwwwooo Ooooooogh!
kids: [all screaming] Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Ned:  Hi kids!  Did I scaredly-dare you?
Bart: Nice try, Mr. Flanders.  But I've got a story so scary you'll wet
your pants!
Abe:  Too late. [kids shift away]

== DIAL "Z" for ZOMBIES ==

Bart gives a book report in front of the class.

Bart:  From A-Apple to Z-Zebra, Baby's First Pop-up book is 26 pages of
alphabetic adventure!
Mrs.K: Bart, you mean to tell me you read a book intended for preschoolers?
Bart:  Well, most of it.

Mrs. Krabappel orders him to find another book to review.  In the school
library, Bart is unimpressed with the latest `Where's Waldo' book (``Man,
he's not trying anymore!'')  He looks around and notices the Occult wing
of the library.

Bart: Gee, I never notice that before.

Bart enters holding a candle chosen from a human skull. A volume flies
out from the shelf, striking Bart on the head.

Book: [Title: ``The Time Life Book of Magic and Spells, Vol.II''
Bart opens the book and four apparitions appear from the pages]
Evil!...EVIL!...MADNESS!...Beware!...BEWARE!
Bart: Cool!  [slams book shut]
Book: Oww!...OWWW!...oww!...OWWW!

In Lisa's room, Bart eagerly reads from the book of magic while Lisa grieves
over a photo of Snowball 1.

Bart: Chapter 8; Let's talk zombies.  If a zombie bites you, you'll become
a zombie.  You must walk the earth, feeding on the brains of the
living until the spell is broken.
Lisa: [annoyed] Bart, please.  Don't you remember that Snowball 1 died four
years ago tonight?  Run over by the Mayor's beer-swilling brother,
Clovis.
Bart: Hey, maybe there's a spell in here that will bring her back from the
dead?  [Lisa stares as Bart flips through the pages]
Let's see what we got.  How to get your skeletons their whitest.
Selling your soul in a buyers' market.  Ahh, here we are: How to raise
the dead. [laughs insanely; lightning flashes add to the effect]

Late at night in the Pet Cemetery.  A Full Moon and stiff breeze provide
the right conditions.  Bart wears a black cape and a Michael Jackson album
cover as he recites the spell.  Lisa anxiously stares at SB1's grave-mark.

Bart: [raising a hand in air] Collin..Rayburn..Nars..Trebek! [lightning]
[raising both hands] Zabars..Kresge..Caldor..Walmart!

As the last syllable leaves his mouth, lightning strikes all the tombstones
in the nearby Human Cemetery.  Zombies appear.

Lisa: [staring at SB1's grave-marker] It's not working. [sighs]
[notices zombies] Bart!  You cast the wrong spell -- ZOMBIES!
Bart: Please Lis, they preferred to be called the `Living Impaired'.

On the grounds of Springfield Elementary, Groundskeeper Willy pats down
the dirt of a flowerbed with a shovel. (``There, pretty as a picture.'')
Two Zombies rise from the ground and walk away, ruining his flowerbed.
Willy repairs the damage. (``There, pretty as a picture.'')

On their bicycles, Bart and Lisa ride with the wind as Zombies give chase.
Zombies knock at Ned Flanders' front door.

Ned:     Well how'd strangers, what can I do you for?
Zombies: BRAINS!  BRAINS!  BRAINS!
Ned:     Well Sue Dolkes, you rascal. [chuckle] I thought you were dead.

Ned screams as the Zombies attack.  At home in the Den, Bart and Lisa
confess to Homer.

Lisa:  Dad, we did something very bad!
Homer: [eating pork rinds, frowns] Did you wreck the car?
Bart:  Nooo!
Homer: [frowns] Did you raise the dead?
Lisa:  Yesss!
Homer: [more frowns] But the car's okay?
Kids:  Uh-huh.
Homer: [relieved] All right then.

Martin hears Principal Skinner's voice over the P.A.  Skinner sits in his
office with his back to us.

Zombie Skinner: Martin Prince, report to my office at once...
[turns around, revealing ghastly features] and bring that big
juicy chess club brain of yours... [licking his lips] Mmmmm!

Homer watches The Krusty the Klown Show as the rest of the family
(including Maggie) board up the windows.  Krusty stands before a large
gift-wrapped box that is the first prize in the Krusty Sweepstakes.

Krusty removes the ribbon and the Zombie Sideshow Mel pops out; dragging
the screaming klown into the box.  The studio broadcasts a `Technical
Difficulties -- Please Stand By' card, but Krusty is soon back on the air.

Zombie Krusty: To enter, send me your parents' brains.  Or write "Parents'
brains" on a three by five card, and send it to...

Marge:  [interrupting] Homer, did you barricade the door?
Homer:  Why?  Oh, the Zombies..  No. [the back door collapses inward]
Family: [seeing the zombies] Aaaaaaaagggggggh!

Homer unselfishly offers himself to the Zombies to allow his family a chance
to escape, but the Zombies ignore him because they can't find a brain.
Homer finds the rest of the family huddled together in the master bedroom.

Bart:  I thought dabbling in the Black Arts would be good for a chuckle, how
wrong I was.  I should have never read that book.
Lisa:  Bart, maybe the library has another book that will reverse the spell?
Marge: It's our only hope!
Homer: [cocking a shotgun] To the book depository!

Homer cautiously leads his family to the car parked outside, but is stopped
by Ned Flanders.

Zombie Flanders: Hey Simpson!  I'm feeling a mite peckish.
[sinisterly] Mind if I chew your EAR?

Homer wastes him.

Bart:  Dad, you killed the Zombie Flanders!
Homer: He was a Zombie!?

In the car to school, Homer listens to the radio for any news.

Radio: KZMB, All Zombie Radio.  Grrrrrrrrrr!

Meanwhile, a Flying Saucer hovers above the Earth.

Alien1: The zombies have the Earthlings on the run.
Alien2: Soon the human race will wither and fold.  Like the
Earth plums we've seen on the Observe-a-scope.

Both Aliens laugh maniacally.  Below, the Simpsons charge their way past a
zombified Jimbo, Kearney and Dolph as the three give Zombie Skinner's head
the boot (``Owww! Careful! Not the face!'')  Homer leads as they bust
through the entrance and storm down the school's corridor.  Homer blows
away a zombie Mrs. Krabappel and a few others before finding Barney
chomping down on an arm.

Homer:  [shocked] Barney, not you too?!
Barney: I'm not a Zombie, but hey, when in Rome...

Barney notices a Zombie George Washington staggering about.  Homer blows
the dead President away, and the Zombie Albert Einstein, and Zombie
William Shakespeare.

Homer: Take that, Washington!
Eat lead, Einstein!
Show's over, Shakespeare!
Will:  [collapsing dramatically] Is this the end of Zombie Shakespeare?

In the occult section of the library, Lisa watches anxiously as the Zombies
smash their way into the room. Bart searches frantically for the right book.

Bart: Kolchak..Mannix..Banacek..Dano!  [-poof- Lisa turns into a snail]
Lisa: What's wrong?
Bart: I never realized what a beautiful young woman you've become.
Lisa: Ahh. [blushes]

Bart: Trojan..Ramses..Magnum..Sheiks!

Brilliant blue light bursts forth from the book, dispersing throughout
Springfield.  Fearing the enchanted light, the zombies return to their
graves.

Zombie1: See you in hell.
Zombie2: Still pushing that boulder?
Zombie1: Uh huh.

Two John Smiths argue over a grave.  In front of City Hall, Mayor Quimby
addresses the crowd.

Quimby: The, aw, Zombies that plagued our town are now just corpses rotting
in our streets.
Crowd:  [cheers]

At home, everything is back to normal.  The Simpsons watch TV.

Marge:  Well, I'm sure glad we didn't turn into mindless zombies.
Bart:   [zombie-like] Shhhhh... T V.
Homer:  [zombie-like] MAN..FALL..DOWN.....FUNNY!
Family: [zombie-like] MMMMMM.

           Any man scoring has to chug a beer.
           You have to chug a beer at the top of all odd-numbered innings.

   And there he goes, off in that direction.  And everyone is happy.
   -- Marge Simpson does the play-by-play, ``Homer at the Bat''
   
<em> Despite Bart's offer to help, Marge maintains that she can handle the
</em><em> play-by-play herself.  The police team hit a homer run and shoot their
</em><em> guns in celebration.  (``Hey, stop that!'' scolds Chief Wiggum.)
</em><em>
</em><em> The game is in the bottom of the ninth, two out, the police up 5 to 2,
</em><em> the bases are loaded, and it's Homer turn at bat.  It's secret weapon
</em><em> time, but when his teammates see that it's his magic bat, they take the
</em><em> opportunity to make fun of it.  (``And I have an enchanted jockstrap,''
</em><em> kids Karl.)
</em><em>
</em><em> Homer steps to the plate, and it's a homer for Homer.  (The ball sails
</em><em> past the fence to a picnic area, striking a man on his head as he is
</em><em> about to eat a sandwich.)  Homer taunts the losing team.  (``Ha ha,
</em><em> cops can't win!''  ``Get his licence and registration,'' orders Chief

</em><em>
</em><em> At home, Homer reviews the videotape as Bart and Lisa admire.

   Lisa:  Wow, Dad!
   Bart:  Homer, can I get you a beer?
   Lisa:  No, &lt;I&gt; want to get him a beer.

<em> But first, Homer re-watches the game-winning hit in super-slow-motion.

</em><em> The nuclear plant team plays against several other opponents, and Homer's

</em><em> At the Millionaire's Club atop the Springfield Trade Center, Smithers

</em>   
   Ari:   Would you care to bet a million dollars on that?
   Burns: Oh, if we're going to bet, why don't we make it interesting!
   Ari:   What, a million dollars isn't interesting to you?
   Burns: Oh, did you say a million?  I'm, I'm sorry, my mind was elsewhere.
          I thought you would start with a small amount, then we would
          bait each other, and, well, you know how it goes.

             a million-dollar bet?
   Smithers: Yes, sir.
   Burns:    Let me rephrase that.  Is it wrong if &lt;I&gt; cheat to win a
             million-dollar bet?
   Smithers: No, sir.  Who would you like killed?

<em> Burns had in mind hiring ringers for the team.  He unveils a

   Marge: What makes you think this Darryl Strawberry character is better
          than you?
   Homer: Marge, forget it.  He's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger
          than me, and he already has more friends around the plant than I do.
   Bart:  You make me sick, Homer.  You're the one who told me I could do
          anything if I just put my mind to it!
   Homer: Well, now that you're a little bit older, I can tell you that's

<em> The team is on the field for practice.  Burns is wearing an old-style

</em><em>
</em><em> In the training room, everybody is working out, except for Homer, who

</em><em>
</em><em> At the plate, Burns demonstrates how to bunt.  But when the ball hits

   Smithers: What are you going to do with the million dollars, sir?
   Burns:    Oh, I dunno.  Throw it on the pile, I suppose.

amorous Scratchy heads to the Space Needle on the advice of his love
with a bouquet of flowers.  He arrives at its base, stands on a large
red X, and emotes love.  Little hearts fly up in the air and burst near
Itchy, who stands atop the tower.  Choosing to ignore a sign that
cautions about throwing pennies from the tower, he removes a penny from
his penny loafer and tosses it over the edge.  It starts moving so fast
that Abe's hair flies back.  It melts a hole right next to Scratchy.

<em>Undaunted, Itchy runs over to a souvenir stand and grabs all the
miniature Space Needles and drops them point first over the edge.  They
land in a heart shape around Scratchy, who emotes some more love.

shadow looms large above Scratchy, who looks up just as the point
skewers him in the eye.  He runs around screaming, emoting love, with

<em>Bart decides to sleep in from of the comic book guy's store that night.
In the morning, the owner arrives.
</em>
<b>Owner: </b>If you are waiting for the Hi &amp; Lois signing, it has been moved
       to the Springfield Coliseum.
 <b>Bart: </b>Please, you have something of mine on a little piece of paper.
<b>Owner: </b>Oh, so you're Bart Simpson, eh?  Well, since my breakfast burrito
       is congealing rapidly, I will be blunt: you're too late.  I sold
       your soul last night.
        [<i>Bart looks worried</i>]
       Yes, yes: I found a buyer right away for _that_ item.
 <b>Bart: </b>Who?
<b>Owner: </b>I am not at liberty to divulge the party, but they were most
       interested in having possession of Little Boy's soul.
        [<i>Bart bangs his head</i>]
       Um, excuse me: no banging your head on the display case, please.
       It contains a very rare Mary Worth in which she has advised a
       friend to commit suicide.  Thank you.  [<i>eats burrito</i>]
-- Too bad that friend wasn't Rex Morgan M.D., "Bart Sells His Soul"

<em>Bart walks home in the rain, dejected.  He enters his room and gets on
his knees.
</em>
<b>Bart: </b>[<i>plaintive</i>] Are you there, God?  It's me, Bart Simpson.  I know I
      never paid too much attention in church, but I could really use
      some of that good stuff now.  I'm...afraid.  I'm afraid some
      weirdo's got my soul and I don't know what they're doing to it!  I
      just want it back.  Please?  [<i>starts to cry</i>] I hope you can hear
      this.
       [<i>his soul floats down from above</i>]
       [<i>he grabs it and hugs it, and sees Lisa standing there</i>]
      Lisa?  _You_ bought this?
<b>Lisa: </b>With the change in my piggy bank.
<b>Bart: </b>There's no change in your piggy bank.
<b>Lisa: </b>Not in any of the ones _you_ know about.
<b>Bart: </b>Oh, Lis, thank you.  [<i>kisses her</i>]
<b>Lisa: </b>Happy to do it.  But you know, Bart, some philosophers believe
      that nobody is born with a soul -- that you have to earn one [<i>Bart
      eats the piece of paper</i>] through suffering and thought and prayer,
      like you did last night.
<b>Bart: </b>Uh huh.  [<i>swallows</i>]
-- Word to the wise, "Bart Sells His Soul"

<em>Bart sleeps with a little smile on his face that night, the family pets
curled up on his bed with him.  In his dream, he and his soul row toward
the green castle on the island.  He hears Martin nearby, "Hah!  It's
like punting on the Thames.  Stroke!  Stroke!"  He and his soul glance
slyly at one another, then steer their boat into Martin's.  Martin's
soul gets knocked over the side.  Bart and his soul laugh and continue
on their way, chuckling.

<em>Homer walks in later, to see Burns surrounded by coffee, sacks and

<b>Burns:</b> No! I thought, uh, I thought I'd chauffeur myself this evening.

       it's not for me.

return.  "Stop fighting like a girl, Simpson!" Smithers yells, and
Homer responds in kind by throwing a punch. Smithers counterattacks
with a punch aimed at Homer's stomach, but his fist is stuck in that
blob of fat. Homer takes the opportunity to taunt Smithers' head, but
shouts out a well-deserved "D'oh!" when his opponent bites him.

polar bear.

<b>Lisa: </b>Come on, Dad.  You can make it!
 <b>Abe: </b>Aw, of course he'll make it.  It's TV.
-- Metahumor, "Deep Space Homer"

<em>The spaceship hurtles towards the earth at a dangerous speed.  It
smashes into the building where the press is housed, which is convenient
in terms of post-trip interviews.
</em>
     <b>Tom: </b>Uh, how'd you solve the door dilemma?
    <b>Buzz: </b>Homer Simpson was the real hero here.  He jury-rigged the door
          closed using this.
   <b>Man 1: </b>Hey, what is that?
   <b>Man 2: </b>It's an inanimate carbon rod!
<b>Everyone: </b>Yay!
           [<i>Time magazine cover: "In Rod We Trust"</i>]
-- Rod Flanders?  Nope, "Deep Space Homer"

<em>A parade is organized in honor of the rod.  It gets to ride in its own
limousine.  The family watch the parade, but Homer turns the TV off
angrily.
</em>
       [<i>Homer shuts off the TV</i>]
 <b>Bart: </b>Aw, they were just about to show some close-ups of the rod!
<b>Homer: </b>Oh, stupid rod!  I got gypped.
<b>Marge: </b>Oh, Homey, you should be proud!  Only a handful of people have
       done what you've done.
 <b>Lisa: </b>Yeah, Dad!  How many people have seen the icecaps and the deserts
       all at once, or the majesty of the Northern Lights from one
       hundred miles above?
<b>Homer: </b>Yeah, maybe I do have the right...what's that stuff?
-- Uh, stuff?, "Deep Space Homer"

<em>Homer thanks his wife and elder daughter.  "Bart, do you have something
nice to say to your father?"  Bart, who has just written "HERO" on
Homer's head, says, "Ehh, he knows how I feel."  He tosses the marker in
the air, and we watch it close up, tumbling slowly.

<em>It turns into a FOX satellite in space, descending slowly to "Also
Sprach Zarathustra".  It hits a glass ball containing a baby Homer in
it, who says, "D'oh!" indignantly.
